This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Cache.matchAll with no matching entries
PASS Cache.matchAll with URL
PASS Cache.matchAll with Request
PASS Cache.matchAll with new Request
PASS Cache.matchAll with HEAD
PASS Cache.matchAll with ignoreSearch option (request with no search parameters)
PASS Cache.matchAll with ignoreSearch option (request with search parameters)
PASS Cache.matchAll supports ignoreMethod
PASS Cache.matchAll supports ignoreVary
PASS Cache.matchAll with URL containing fragment
PASS Cache.matchAll with string fragment "http" as query
PASS Cache.matchAll without parameters
PASS Cache.matchAll with explicitly undefined request
PASS Cache.matchAll with explicitly undefined request and empty options
FAIL Cache.matchAll with responses containing "Vary" header assert_equals: Cache.matchAll should match the entire header if a vary header is present in both the query and cached requests. expected 1 but got 0
FAIL Cache.matchAll with multiple vary pairs assert_equals: Cache.matchAll should support multiple vary request/response pairs. expected 3 but got 1
Harness: the test ran to completion.
