// Capability to access the cookie store on behalf of a single origin.

  // the "site for cookies" values defined in RFC 6265bis, and roughly maps to
  // the URL of the top-level frame in Document contexts, and to the script URL
  // in service workers. |top_frame_origin| is the actual origin of the top
  // level frame or the script url for service workers. |site_for_cookies| is
  // used to determine if a cookie is accessed in a third-party context.
  // |top_frame_origin| is used to check for content settings.
  // |has_storage_access| is used to opt-in to using Storage Access API
  // permission grants. (Note: it does *not* grant access on its own, but rather
  // allows an existing permission grant to be used, if one exists.)
  // |options| filters the returned list of cookies. The returned cookies
  // include CookieAccessResult information of the cookie.

  // as part of CookieAccessResult in the included cookies may be passed to an
  // untrusted renderer.
