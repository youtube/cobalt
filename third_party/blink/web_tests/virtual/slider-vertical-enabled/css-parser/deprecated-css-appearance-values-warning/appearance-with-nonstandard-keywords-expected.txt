CONSOLE WARNING: The keyword 'slider-vertical' specified to an 'appearance' property is not standardized. It will be removed in the future. Use <input type=range style="writing-mode: vertical-lr; direction: rtl"> instead.
This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] There should be console warnings about non-standard appearance keywords
  assert_true: This should FAIL so we generate a -expected.txt expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
