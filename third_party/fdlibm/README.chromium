Description:
The V8 project has a math library implementation, v8/src/base/ieee754.cc,
derived from significant Google, Inc. changes to the NetBSD version of fdlibm.
This library is a copy of that V8 library intended for use in Chromium.

This library may be useful when mathematical consistency across OS platforms is
desired.

The initial commit is not a pristine import -- the patch in the chromium/
subdirectory documents the changes made to the original sources. This patch was
produced via `git diff` and can be applied using `git apply`.

Changes from V8 upstream:
- Changed namespace to fdlibm.
- Alter //v8/src/base usage to use Chromium //base equivalents.
- Implement 32-bit float functions (sinf(), etc.) by calling the 64-bit
  versions.
- Format the code.
- Remove MSVC code, which is not supported by Chromium anymore.
