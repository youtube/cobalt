```

The first event that a Starboard application receives is either `Start`
(`kSbEventTypeStart`) or `Preload` (`kSbEventTypePreload`). `Start` puts the
application in the `STARTED` state, whereas `Preload` puts the application in
the `CONCEALED` state.

In the `STARTED` state, the application is in the foreground and can expect to
do all of the normal things it might want to do. Once in the `STARTED` state, it
may receive a `Blur` event, putting the application into the `BLURRED` state.

In the `BLURRED` state, the application is still visible, but has lost focus, or
it is partially obscured by a modal dialog, or it is on its way to being shut
down. The application should blur activity in this state. In this state, it can
receive `Focus` to be brought back to the foreground state (`STARTED`), or
`Conceal` to be pushed to the `CONCEALED` state.

In the `CONCEALED` state, the application should behave as it should for an
invisible program that can still run, and that can optionally access the network
and playback audio, albeit potentially will have less CPU and memory available.
The application may get switched from `CONCEALED` to `FROZEN` at any time, when
the platform decides to do so.

In the `FROZEN` state, the application is not visible. It should immediately
release all graphics and video resources, and shut down all background activity
(timers, rendering, etc). Additionally, the application should flush storage to
ensure that if the application is killed, the storage will be up-to-date. The
application may be killed at this point, but will ideally receive a `Stop` event
for a more graceful shutdown.

Note that the application is always expected to transition through `BLURRED`,
`CONCEALED` to `FROZEN` before receiving `Stop` or being killed.

## Enums ##

### SbEventType ###

An enumeration of all possible event types dispatched directly by the system.
Each event is accompanied by a void* data argument, and each event must define
the type of the value pointed to by that data argument, if any.

#### Values ####

*   `kSbEventTypePreload`

    The system may send `kSbEventTypePreload` in `UNSTARTED` if it wants to push
    the app into a lower resource consumption state. Applications will also call
    SbSystemRequestConceal() when they request this. The only events that should
    be dispatched after a Preload event are Reveal or Freeze. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeStart`

    The first event that an application receives on startup when starting
    normally. Applications should perform initialization, start running, and
    prepare to react to subsequent events. Applications that wish to run and
    then exit must call `SbSystemRequestStop()` to terminate. This event will
    only be sent once for a given process launch. `SbEventStartData` is passed
    as the data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeBlur`

    A dialog will be raised or the application will otherwise be put into a
    background-but-visible or partially-obscured state (BLURRED). Graphics and
    video resources will still be available, but the application could pause
    foreground activity like animations and video playback. Can only be received
    after a Start event. The only events that should be dispatched after a Blur
    event are Focus or Conceal. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeFocus`

    The application is returning to the foreground (STARTED) after having been
    put in the BLURRED (e.g. partially-obscured) state. The application should
    resume foreground activity like animations and video playback. Can only be
    received after a Blur or Reveal event. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeConceal`

    The operating system will put the application into the Concealed state after
    this event is handled. The application is expected to be made invisible, but
    background tasks can still be running, such as audio playback, or updating
    of recommendations. Can only be received after a Blur or Reveal event. The
    only events that should be dispatched after a Conceal event are Freeze or
    Reveal. On some platforms, the process may also be killed after Conceal
    without a Freeze event.
*   `kSbEventTypeReveal`

    The operating system will restore the application to the BLURRED state from
    the CONCEALED state. This is the first event the application will receive
    coming out of CONCEALED, and it can be received after a Conceal or Unfreeze
    event. The application will now be in the BLURRED state. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeFreeze`

    The operating system will put the application into the Frozen state after
    this event is handled. The application is expected to stop periodic
    background work, release ALL graphics and video resources, and flush any
    pending SbStorage writes. Some platforms will terminate the application if
    work is done or resources are retained after freezing. Can be received after
    a Conceal or Unfreeze event. The only events that should be dispatched after
    a Freeze event are Unfreeze or Stop. On some platforms, the process may also
    be killed after Freeze without a Stop event. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeUnfreeze`

    The operating system has restored the application to the CONCEALED state
    from the FROZEN state. This is the first event the application will receive
    coming out of FROZEN, and it will only be received after a Freeze event. The
    application will now be in the CONCEALED state. NO data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeStop`

    The operating system will shut the application down entirely after this
    event is handled. Can only be received after a Freeze event, in the FROZEN
    state. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeInput`

    A user input event, including keyboard, mouse, gesture, or something else.
    SbInputData (from input.h) is passed as the data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeUser`

    A user change event, which means a new user signed-in or signed-out, or the
    current user changed. No data argument, call SbUserGetSignedIn() and
    SbUserGetCurrent() to get the latest changes.
*   `kSbEventTypeLink`

    A navigational link has come from the system, and the application should
    consider handling it by navigating to the corresponding application
    location. The data argument is an application-specific, null-terminated
    string.
*   `kSbEventTypeVerticalSync`

    The beginning of a vertical sync has been detected. This event is very
    timing-sensitive, so as little work as possible should be done on the main
    thread if the application wants to receive this event in a timely manner. No
    data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeScheduled`

    An event type reserved for scheduled callbacks. It will only be sent in
    response to an application call to SbEventSchedule(), and it will call the
    callback directly, so SbEventHandle should never receive this event
    directly. The data type is an internally-defined structure.
*   `kSbEventTypeAccessibilitySettingsChanged`

    The platform's accessibility settings have changed. The application should
    query the accessibility settings using the appropriate APIs to get the new
    settings. Note this excludes captions settings changes, which causes
    kSbEventTypeAccessibilityCaptionSettingsChanged to fire. If the starboard
    version has kSbEventTypeAccessib(i)lityTextToSpeechSettingsChanged, then
    that event should be used to signal text-to-speech settings changes instead;
    platforms using older starboard versions should use
    kSbEventTypeAccessib(i)litySettingsChanged for text-to-speech settings
    changes.
*   `kSbEventTypeLowMemory`

    An optional event that platforms may send to indicate that the application
    may soon be terminated (or crash) due to low memory availability. The
    application may respond by reducing memory consumption by running a Garbage
    Collection, flushing caches, or something similar. There is no requirement
    to respond to or handle this event, it is only advisory.
*   `kSbEventTypeWindowSizeChanged`

    The size or position of a SbWindow has changed. The data is
    SbEventWindowSizeChangedData .
*   `kSbEventTypeOnScreenKeyboardShown`

    The platform has shown the on screen keyboard. This event is triggered by
    the system or by the application's OnScreenKeyboard show method. The event
    has int data representing a ticket. The ticket is used by the application to
    mark individual calls to the show method as successfully completed. Events
    triggered by the application have tickets passed in via
    SbWindowShowOnScreenKeyboard. System-triggered events have ticket value
    kSbEventOnScreenKeyboardInvalidTicket.
*   `kSbEventTypeOnScreenKeyboardHidden`

    The platform has hidden the on screen keyboard. This event is triggered by
    the system or by the application's OnScreenKeyboard hide method. The event
    has int data representing a ticket. The ticket is used by the application to
    mark individual calls to the hide method as successfully completed. Events
    triggered by the application have tickets passed in via
    SbWindowHideOnScreenKeyboard. System-triggered events have ticket value
    kSbEventOnScreenKeyboardInvalidTicket.
*   `kSbEventTypeOnScreenKeyboardFocused`

    The platform has focused the on screen keyboard. This event is triggered by
    the system or by the application's OnScreenKeyboard focus method. The event
    has int data representing a ticket. The ticket is used by the application to
    mark individual calls to the focus method as successfully completed. Events
    triggered by the application have tickets passed in via
    SbWindowFocusOnScreenKeyboard. System-triggered events have ticket value
    kSbEventOnScreenKeyboardInvalidTicket.
*   `kSbEventTypeOnScreenKeyboardBlurred`

    The platform has blurred the on screen keyboard. This event is triggered by
    the system or by the application's OnScreenKeyboard blur method. The event
    has int data representing a ticket. The ticket is used by the application to
    mark individual calls to the blur method as successfully completed. Events
    triggered by the application have tickets passed in via
    SbWindowBlurOnScreenKeyboard. System-triggered events have ticket value
    kSbEventOnScreenKeyboardInvalidTicket.
*   `kSbEventTypeOnScreenKeyboardSuggestionsUpdated`

    The platform has updated the on screen keyboard suggestions. This event is
    triggered by the system or by the application's OnScreenKeyboard update
    suggestions method. The event has int data representing a ticket. The ticket
    is used by the application to mark individual calls to the update
    suggestions method as successfully completed. Events triggered by the
    application have tickets passed in via
    SbWindowUpdateOnScreenKeyboardSuggestions. System-triggered events have
    ticket value kSbEventOnScreenKeyboardInvalidTicket.
*   `kSbEventTypeAccessibilityCaptionSettingsChanged`

    One or more of the fields returned by SbAccessibilityGetCaptionSettings has
    changed.
*   `kSbEventTypeAccessibilityTextToSpeechSettingsChanged`

    The platform's text-to-speech settings have changed.
*   `kSbEventTypeOsNetworkDisconnected`

    The platform has detected a network disconnection. There are likely to be
    cases where the platform cannot detect the disconnection but the platform
    should make a best effort to send an event of this type when the network
    disconnects. This event is used to implement window.onoffline DOM event.
*   `kSbEventTypeOsNetworkConnected`

    The platform has detected a network connection. There are likely to be cases
    where the platform cannot detect the connection but the platform should make
    a best effort to send an event of this type when the device is just
    connected to the internet. This event is used to implement window.ononline
    DOM event.
*   `kSbEventDateTimeConfigurationChanged`

    The platform has detected a date and/or time configuration change (such as a
    change in the timezone setting). This should trigger the application to re-
    query the relevant APIs to update the date and time.

## Typedefs ##

### SbEventCallback ###

A function that can be called back from the main Starboard event pump.

#### Definition ####

```
typedef void(* SbEventCallback) (void *context)
```

### SbEventDataDestructor ###

A function that will cleanly destroy an event data instance of a specific type.

#### Definition ####

```
typedef void(* SbEventDataDestructor) (void *data)
```

### SbEventId ###

An ID that can be used to refer to a scheduled event.

#### Definition ####

```
typedef uint32_t SbEventId
```

## Structs ##

### SbEvent ###

Structure representing a Starboard event and its data.

#### Members ####

*   `SbEventType type`
*   `SbTimeMonotonic timestamp`
*   `void * data`

### SbEventStartData ###

Event data for kSbEventTypeStart events.

#### Members ####

*   `char ** argument_values`

    The command-line argument values (argv).
*   `int argument_count`

    The command-line argument count (argc).
*   `const char * link`

    The startup link, if any.

### SbEventWindowSizeChangedData ###

Event data for kSbEventTypeWindowSizeChanged events.

#### Members ####

*   `SbWindow window`
*   `SbWindowSize size`

## Functions ##

### SbEventCancel ###

Cancels the specified `event_id`. Note that this function is a no-op if the
event already fired. This function can be safely called from any thread, but the
only way to guarantee that the event does not run anyway is to call it from the
main Starboard event loop thread.

#### Declaration ####

```
void SbEventCancel(SbEventId event_id)
```

### SbEventHandle ###

The entry point that Starboard applications MUST implement. Any memory pointed
at by `event` or the `data` field inside `event` is owned by the system, and
that memory is reclaimed after this function returns, so the implementation must
copy this data to extend its life. This behavior should also be assumed of all
fields within the `data` object, unless otherwise explicitly specified.

This function is only called from the main Starboard thread. There is no
specification about what other work might happen on this thread, so the
application should generally do as little work as possible on this thread, and
just dispatch it over to another thread.

#### Declaration ####

```
SB_IMPORT void SbEventHandle(const SbEvent *event)
```

### SbEventIsIdValid ###

Returns whether the given event handle is valid.

#### Declaration ####

```
static bool SbEventIsIdValid(SbEventId handle)
```

### SbEventSchedule ###

Schedules an event `callback` into the main Starboard event loop. This function
may be called from any thread, but `callback` is always called from the main
Starboard thread, queued with other pending events.

`callback`: The callback function to be called. Must not be NULL. `context`: The
context that is passed to the `callback` function. `delay`: The minimum number
of microseconds to wait before calling the `callback` function. Set `delay` to
`0` to call the callback as soon as possible.

#### Declaration ####

```
SbEventId SbEventSchedule(SbEventCallback callback, void *context, SbTime delay)
```
