caption: Print Rasterize PDF DPI
default: 0
desc: |-
  Controls print image resolution when <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> prints PDFs with rasterization.

        When printing a PDF using the Print to image option, it can be beneficial to specify a print resolution other than a device's printer setting or the PDF default.  A high resolution will significantly increase the processing and printing time while a low resolution can lead to poor imaging quality.

        This policy allows a particular resolution to be specified for use when rasterizing PDFs for printing.

        If this policy is set to zero or not set at all then the system default resolution will be used during rasterization of page images.
