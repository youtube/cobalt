This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] setSinkId on default audio output should always work
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "AbortError: The operation could not be performed and was aborted"
[FAIL] setSinkId fails with NotFoundError on made up deviceid
  promise_rejects_dom: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "AbortError: The operation could not be performed and was aborted" that is not a DOMException NotFoundError: property "code" is equal to 20, expected 8
[FAIL] setSinkId() with output device ID exposed by selectAudioOutput() should resolve
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.mediaDevices.selectAudioOutput is not a function"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
