This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] [lstmCell] Throw if the input data type is not one of the floating point types
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint32 for input operand named 'input', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [lstmCell] Throw if the data type of hiddenState is incorrect
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int64 for input operand named 'hiddenState', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [lstmCell] Throw if the data type of options.bias is incorrect
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int8 for input operand named 'bias', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [lstmCell] Throw if the data type of options.recurrentBias is incorrect
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint8 for input operand named 'recurrentBias', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
