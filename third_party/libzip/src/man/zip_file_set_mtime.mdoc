.Dt ZIP_FILE_SET_MTIME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm zip_file_set_dostime ,
.Nm zip_file_set_mtime
.Nd set last modification time (mtime) for file in zip
.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Ft int
.Fn zip_file_set_dostime "zip_t *archive" "zip_uint64_t index" "zip_uint16_t dostime" "zip_uint16_t dosdate" "zip_flags_t flags"
.Ft int
.Fn zip_file_set_mtime "zip_t *archive" "zip_uint64_t index" "time_t mtime" "zip_flags_t flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn zip_file_set_mtime
function sets the last modification time (mtime) for the file at
position
.Ar index
in the zip archive to
.Ar mtime .
Currently, no support for any
.Ar flags
is implemented.
.Pp
In the zip archive, the time and date are saved as two 16-bit integers.
To set the values directly, call the
.Fn zip_file_set_dostime
function.
The values of the time bytes are defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 5n -offset indent
.It 0-4
day of the month (1-31)
.It 5-8
month (January = 1, February = 2, ...)
.It 9-15
year offset from 1980 (1980 = 0, 1981 = 1, ...)
.El
.Pp
The values of the date bytes are defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 5n -offset indent
.It 0-4
seconds divided by two (1-2 = 1, 3-4 = 2, ...)
.It 5-10
minute (0-59)
.It 11-15
hour (0-23)
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error information in
.Ar archive
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn zip_file_set_dostime
and
.Fn zip_file_set_mtime
fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ZIP_ER_INVAL
.Ar index
is not a valid file index in
.Ar archive .
.It Bq Er ZIP_ER_MEMORY
Required memory could not be allocated.
.It Bq Er ZIP_ER_RDONLY
The
.Ar archive
was opened in read-only mode.

.Sh CAVEATS
Following historical practice, the
.Fn zip_file_set_mtime
function translates the time from the zip archive into the local time
zone.
If you want to avoid this, use the
.Fn zip_file_set_dostime
function instead.
