// Provides logic of when to show the IPH promo for this feature.
//
// Current logic is "periodically, starting after the session start grace
// period". This is really not great, except that none of the alternatives were
// any better.
//
// For example, consider checking every time the active page changes. This would
// require lots of observers (tab strip selection, active web contents
// navigation) that would need to be kept updated. It would also run during
// grace and cooldown periods where the promo could not possibly be shown, and
// without additional delay logic would show the IPH - and interrupt the user -
// as soon as they landed on a new page, which could happen during e.g.
// tab-switching or clicking links (which would be very bad).
//
// A potential future upgrade is to do the above, but put showing the promo on a
// delay timer so that it schedules to show, say, ten seconds after an eligible
// page is active and ready, and any tab-switching or navigation in that window
// results in the timer being reset. For now, however, this implementation
// suffices.
