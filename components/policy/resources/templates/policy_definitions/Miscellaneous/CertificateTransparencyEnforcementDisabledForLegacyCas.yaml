caption: Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of Legacy Certificate
  Authorities
desc: |-
  Setting the policy turns off enforcement of Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities (CA) for certificate chains with a specified <ph name="SUBJECT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO">subjectPublicKeyInfo</ph> hash. Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn't be trusted (because they weren't properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the <ph name="SUBJECT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO">subjectPublicKeyInfo</ph> hash must appear in a CA certificate recognized as a Legacy CA. A Legacy CA is publicly trusted by one or more operating systems supported by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>, but not Android Open Source Project or <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>.

        Specify a <ph name="SUBJECT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO">subjectPublicKeyInfo</ph> hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded <ph name="SUBJECT_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO">subjectPublicKeyInfo</ph> of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored.

        Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren't disclosed, then <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> doesn't trust those certificates.
