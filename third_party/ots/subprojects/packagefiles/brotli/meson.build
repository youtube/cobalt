# The brotli encoder contains static symbols with the same names in different
# translation units, so it does not support unity builds. Since we only need
# the decoder, we have simply removed the brotli_encoder_dep dependency in
# order to depend on brotli without breaking unity builds.
#
# We also define BROTLI_BUILD_PORTABLE whenever b_sanitize is set, even when
# default_library is static.
