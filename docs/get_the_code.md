# Get the code: check out, build, and run Chromium.

[Browse or Search Chromium Code](https://source.chromium.org/chromium) online.

Chromium supports building on Windows, Mac and Linux host systems.

The process for building Chrome is generally the same on all platforms, but
each platform has a few quirks. In order to keep you from having to jump
all over the place, we have a self-contained page for each configuration
you might want to build:

* [Android](android_build_instructions.md) (Build on Linux)
* [Android Cast](android_cast_build_instructions.md) (Build on Linux)
* [Chrome OS](chromeos_build_instructions.md) (Build on Linux)
* [Fuchsia](fuchsia/build_instructions.md)
* [iOS](ios/build_instructions.md) (Build on Mac)
* [Linux](linux/build_instructions.md)
* [Linux Cast](linux/cast_build_instructions.md)
* [Mac](mac_build_instructions.md)
* [Windows](windows_build_instructions.md)
