default: none
desc: |2-

  Default behavior (Policy unset)
  When an account is added in the content area a small dialog may appear asking the user to create a new profile. This dialog is dismissable.

  <ph name="MANAGED_ACCOUNTS_SIGNIN_RESTRICTION_POLICY_NAME">ManagedAccountsSigninRestriction</ph> = <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_PRIMARY_ACCOUNT">'primary_account'</ph>
  If a user signs into a Google service for the first time in a <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> browser, a dialog will appear asking the user to create a new profile for their enterprise account. The user may click Cancel and get signed out, or Continue to create a new profile. Any existing browsing data will not be added to the new profile. The newly created profile is allowed to have secondary accounts, for example the user can sign into another account in the content area.

  <ph name="MANAGED_ACCOUNTS_SIGNIN_RESTRICTION_POLICY_NAME">ManagedAccountsSigninRestriction</ph> = <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_STRICT">'primary_account_strict'</ph>
  This is the same behavior as <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_PRIMARY_ACCOUNT">'primary_account'</ph> except the newly created profile is not allowed to have secondary accounts.

  <ph name="MANAGED_ACCOUNTS_SIGNIN_RESTRICTION_POLICY_NAME">ManagedAccountsSigninRestriction</ph> = <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_KEEP_EXISTING_DATA">'primary_account_keep_existing_data'</ph>
  This is the same behavior as <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_PRIMARY_ACCOUNT">'primary_account'</ph> except a checkbox will be added to the dialog to allow the user to keep local browsing data.
  If the user checks the box, then the existing profile data becomes associated with the Managed account.
  -  All existing browsing data will be present in the new profile.
  -  This data includes bookmarks, history, password, autofill data, open tabs, cookies, cache, web storage, extensions, etc.
  If the user does not check the box:
  -  The old profile will continue to exist, no data will be lost.
  -  A new profile will be created.

  <ph name="MANAGED_ACCOUNTS_SIGNIN_RESTRICTION_POLICY_NAME">ManagedAccountsSigninRestriction</ph> = <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_STRICT_KEEP_EXISTING_DATA">'primary_account_strict_keep_existing_data'</ph>
  This is the same behavior as <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_KEEP_EXISTING_DATA">'primary_account_keep_existing_data'</ph> except the newly created profile is not allowed to have secondary accounts.
