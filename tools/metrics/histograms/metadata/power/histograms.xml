    (Mac only) The sum of the Energy Impact of each process of the type

    NOTE: This metric has one signigicant limitation, it doesn't report the CPU
    usage of processes that terminate before the end of the interval. This means
    that short lived processes will rarely be included in the data. Furthermore,

    The battery percentage of the system when the AC charger is unplugged. This
    metric is recorded upon unplug of an AC charger, unless the system is
    shutdown. Since this metric is only reported when the battery percentage has
    reached the hold percent (the battery charge % that charging is delayed at,
    which is 80%) for Adaptive Charging, most values should be high.

    We record this under several variants, which split this result by the type
    of charging that is used to charge to full once the hold percent is reached.
    Normal charging uses the default rate of charging, slow charging uses a
    battery charge current limit of 0.1C (10% of battery design capacity) and
    mixed charging is a combination of both normal and slow charging which can
    occur when the unplug time prediction moves sooner, resulting in the switch
    from slow charging to normal charging in order to finish charging by the
    unplug time predicted.

    The difference between the correct delay time and the actual delay time for
    Adaptive Charging, as computed by (correct delay - actual delay) in minutes.
    Adaptive Charging delays charging from a hold charge percentage, 80%, to
    full if it predicts the charger will be unplugged more than 3 hours in the
    future. The correct delay time ends exactly 3 hours before the user unplugs
    the charger, or 2 hours before the user unplugs if the available time is
    less than 3 hours. This metric is recorded upon unplug of an AC charger, if
    the hold percent was reached.

    We record this under several variants, which split this result by whether
    Adaptive Charging is enabled and active, a heuristic disabled the feature,
    the user canceled the feature for this use, the user disabled the feature,
    or the feature is not supported on the hardware class. We still record the
    metric if the feature is not supported, since we may backport support to
    older systems, and we'd like to know how well the ML model does before
    enabling support.

    Since metrics don't work with negative values, this is additionally split
    across Late and Early variants. The absolute values of negatives are
    reported under the Late variant. Positive and 0 values are reported under

    Total seconds of CPU time consumed by Chrome, split by process type as well

    every second of CPU time consumed by a process on a specific CPU core type
    and at a specific frequency, a sample is recorded into the bucket for the
    frequency range. Samples are recorded periodically depending on the task
    load of each process's main thread. The histogram thus shows the total sum
    of CPU time seconds spent for a specific process and core type across all
    users.

    Compared with Power.CpuTimeSecondsPerCoreTypeAndFrequency, the values in
    this histogram are approximated from more widely supported global

    every 30 seconds while foregrounded. Also sampled when Chrome is
    backgrounded or the device connects to a charger. {Exclusive}

    Sample values are reported in microampere-hours and averaged over successive
    sampling points without a change in capacity counter values. Since the
    capacity counter resolution differs between device models, averaging the
    values allows us to make comparisons between frequent small capacity drops
    and infrequent large drops. For example, a 20,000 uAh drop over two
    successive periods of 30 seconds will be reported as two samples of 10,000
    uAh.

    For more details, see http://bit.ly/chrome-android-foreground-battery-drain.

    Only supported on Android. For WebView, the metric considers the time during
    in which at least one WebView is visible on the screen as
    &quot;foreground&quot; time. For Chrome, it considers any time the Chrome
    app is visible, including when in multi-window mode.

    Note that the capacity counter can be implemented in different ways by
    different devices/OEMs and its accuracy can vary (across devices and at
    different times on the same device, also due to environmental factors like
    device temperature or charge level).

    We've found looking at the 99%ile-trimmed mean more useful than looking at
    specific percentiles, especially when filtering for specific device models.

    This histogram is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

    Sample values are reported as provided by the battery capacity counter (in

    This is the status code returned by the model when calculating a user
    inactivity score. If it is any value other than 0 (success), then some issue
    has occurred in the score calculation, either because preprocess was not
    loaded or parsed correctly, or the preprocessor failed to process a
    RankerExample. Only applicable to Chrome OS.
