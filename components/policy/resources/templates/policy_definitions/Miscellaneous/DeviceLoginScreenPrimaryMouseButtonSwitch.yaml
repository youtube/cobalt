  Switch the primary mouse button to the right button on the login screen.

            If this policy is set to enabled, the right button of the mouse will always be the primary key on the login screen.

            If this policy is set to disabled, the left button of the mouse will always be the primary key on the login screen.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, the left button of the mouse will be the primary key on the login screen initially, but can be switched by the user anytime.
