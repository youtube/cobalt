caption: Block access to a list of URL patterns during authentication
desc: |-
  Setting the policy prevents webpages with prohibited URLs from loading during user authentication (e.g. in the login screen and lock screen). It provides a list of URL patterns that specify forbidden URLs. Leaving the policy unset means no URLs are prohibited during authentication. Format the URL pattern according to this format ( https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format ).

  Exceptions to these patterns can be defined in the related policy <ph name="DEVICE_AUTHENTICATION_URL_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">DeviceAuthenticationURLAllowlist</ph>.

  Certain URLs are necessary for authentication to succeed, including accounts.google.com, so they should not be blocked if online sign-in is required.

  Note: This policy does not apply to in-page JavaScript URLs with dynamically loaded data. If you blocked example.com/abc, then example.com could still load it using XMLHTTPRequest.
