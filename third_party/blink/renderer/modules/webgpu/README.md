# WebGPU Blink module

The WebGPU API is the successor to the WebGL and WebGL 2 graphics APIs for the Web.
It will provide modern features such as “GPU compute” as well as lower overhead access to GPU hardware and better, more predictable performance.
WebGPU is being developed by the [“GPU for the Web”](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/) W3C community group.
