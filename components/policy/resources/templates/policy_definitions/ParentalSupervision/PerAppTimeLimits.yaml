caption: Per-App Time Limits
desc: |-
  Allows to set per-app usage restrictions.
          Usage restrictions can be applied to the apps installed on <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> for the given user.
          Restrictions should be passed in |app_limits| list. Only one entry per-app is allowed. Apps not included in the list have no restrictions.
          It is not possible to block apps that are essential for the operating system, the restrictions for such apps will be ignored.
          App is uniquely identified by |app_id|. Since different types of apps can use different id format |app_type| needs to be specified next to |app_id|.
          Per-App Time Limits only support |ARC| apps currently. Android package name is used as |app_id|.
          Support for other types of applications will be added in the future, for now they can be specified in the policy, but the restrictions will take no effect.
          There are two types of available restrictions: |BLOCK| and |TIME_LIMIT|.
          |BLOCK| makes app unavailable for the user. If |daily_limit_mins| is specified with |BLOCK| restriction |daily_limit_mins| will be ignored.
          |TIME_LIMITS| applies daily usage limit and makes app unavailable after the limit is reached on the given day. Usage limit is specified in |daily_limit_mins|. Usage limit is reset daily at the UTC time passed in |reset_at|.
          This policy is only used for child users.
          This policy is complementary to 'UsageTimeLimit'. Restrictions specified in 'UsageTimeLimit' like screen time and bedtime will be enforced regardless of 'PerAppTimeLimits'.
