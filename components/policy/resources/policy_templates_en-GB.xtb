      The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such
      as '*.example.com') for which security restrictions on insecure origins
      will not apply.

      The intent is to allow organisations to set whitelist origins for legacy
      applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for
      internal web development so that their developers can test out features
      requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging
      server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labelled
      'Not Secure' in the omnibox.

      Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the
      command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a
      comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will

      This policy allows you to provide printer configurations to <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME" /> devices.  The format is the same as the NativePrinters dictionary, with an additional required 'id' or 'guid' field per printer for whitelisting or blacklisting.

      The size of the file must not exceed 5 MB and must be encoded in JSON.  It is estimated that a file containing approximately 21,000 printers will encode as a 5 MB file. The cryptographic hash is used to verify the integrity of the download.

      The file is downloaded and cached. It will be re-downloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes.

      If this policy is set, <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME" /> will download the file for printer configurations and make printers available in accordance with <ph name="DEVICE_PRINTERS_ACCESS_MODE" />, <ph name="DEVICE_PRINTERS_WHITELIST" /> and <ph name="DEVICE_PRINTERS_BLACKLIST" />.

      This policy has no effect on whether users can configure printers on individual devices. It is intended to be supplementary to the configuration of printers by individual users.

      If this policy is unset, there will be no device printers and the other <ph name="DEVICE_PRINTERS_POLICY_PATTERN" /> policies will be ignored.

<translation id="2486371469462493753">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements to the listed URLs.

      This policy allows certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs to not be disclosed via Certificate Transparency. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used, but makes it harder to detect miss-isued certificates for those hosts.

      A URL pattern is formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format. However, because certificates are valid for a given hostname independent of the scheme, port or path, only the hostname portion of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

      If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</translation>

          The |time_window_limit| specifies a daily window in which the user's session should be locked. We only support one rule for each day of the week, therefore the |entries| array may vary from 0 to 7 in size. |starts_at| and |ends_at| are the beginning and the end of the window limit, when |ends_at| is smaller than |starts_at| it means that the |time_limit_window| ends on the following day. |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time that this entry was updated; it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

          The |time_usage_limit| specifies a daily screen quota, so when the user reaches it, the user's session is locked. There is a property for each day of the week, and it should be set only if there is an active quota for that day. |usage_quota_mins| is the amount of time that the managed device can be used in a day and |reset_at| is the time when the usage quota is renewed. The default value for |reset_at| is midnight ({'hour': 0, 'minute': 0}). |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time that this entry was updated; it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

          |overrides| is provided to invalidate temporarily one or more of the previous rules.
          * If neither time_window_limit nor time_usage_limit is active, |LOCK| can be used to lock the device.
          * |LOCK| temporarily locks a user session until the next time_window_limit or time_usage_limit starts.
          * |UNLOCK| unlocks a user's session locked by time_window_limit or time_usage_limit.
          |created_time_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the override creation; it is sent as a String because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer. It is used to determine whether this override should still be applied. If the current active time limit feature (time usage limit or time window limit) started after the override was created, it should not take action. Also, if the override was created before the last change of the active time_window_limit or time_usage_window, it should not be applied.

      This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

      In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, the hash must be of a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognised as a Legacy Certificate Authority (CA). A Legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by one or more operating systems supported by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />, but is not trusted by the Android Open Source Project or <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME" />.

      A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the '/' character and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognised hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is 'sha256'.

      If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</translation>

          including any additional permissions requested by future versions of
          the app/extension. Furthermore, permissions are granted for the
          enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension
          APIs. (These two APIs are not available to apps/extensions that are
          not force-installed.)

          This policy takes precedence over a potentially conflicting <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_BLACKLIST_POLICY_NAME" /> policy. If an app or extension that previously had been force-installed is removed from this list, it is automatically uninstalled by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />.

          For Windows, instances that are not joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME" /> domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

          Note that the source code of any extension may be altered by users via Developer Tools (potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional). If this is a concern, the <ph name="DEVELOPER_TOOLS_POLICY_NAME" /> policy should be set.

          Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an 'update' URL separated by a semicolon (<ph name="SEMICOLON" />). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on <ph name="CHROME_EXTENSIONS_LINK" /> when in developer mode. The 'update' URL, if specified, should point to an Update Manifest XML document as described at <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC1" />. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used (which currently is "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx"). Note that the 'update' URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest. Note: Specifying the 'update' URL explicitly was mandatory in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" /> versions up to and including 67.

          For example, <ph name="EXTENSION_POLICY_EXAMPLE" /> installs the extension with ID <ph name="EXTENSION_ID_SAMPLE" /> from the standard Chrome Web Store 'update' URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC2" />.

          If this policy is left not set, no apps or extensions are installed automatically and the user can uninstall any app or extension in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />.

          Note that this policy doesn't apply to incognito mode.</translation>

      When this policy is set to ClientCertificate (value 1), client certificate authentication is used for newly added users which log in via SAML. No passwords are used for such users, and their cached local data is protected using corresponding cryptographic keys.

          For each of the above delays, when the length of time is unset, a default value will be used.

Each item in the list must contain both devices and URLs in order for the policy to be valid. Each item in devices can contain a vendor ID and product ID field. Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.

        The USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site ('requesting URL') and the URL of the top-level frame site ('embedding URL') to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different from the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the 'URLs' field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status. The URLs in 'URLs' must be valid URLs, otherwise the policy will be ignored.

Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.

        The USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site ('requesting URL') and the URL of the top-level frame site ('embedding URL') to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different from the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the 'URLs' field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively.

The URLs in 'URLs' must be valid URLs, otherwise the policy will be ignored.

      If you enable this setting, the specified list of plugins can be used in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />. Users can enable or disable them in 'about:plugins', even if the plugin also matches a pattern in DisabledPlugins. Users can also enable and disable plugins that don't match any patterns in DisabledPlugins, DisabledPluginsExceptions and EnabledPlugins.

      This policy is meant to allow for strict plugin blacklisting where the 'DisabledPlugins' list contains wildcarded entries such as disable all plugins '*' or disable all Java plugins '*Java*' but the administrator wishes to enable some particular version such as 'IcedTea Java 2.3'. This particular versions can be specified in this policy.

      Note that both the plugin name and the plugin's group name have to be exempted. Each plugin group is shown in a separate section in about:plugins; each section may have one or more plugins. For example, the 'Shockwave Flash' plugin belongs to the 'Adobe Flash Player' group, and both names have to have a match in the exceptions list if that plugin is to be exempted from the blacklist.

      If this policy is left not set, any plugin that matches the patterns in the 'DisabledPlugins' will be locked disabled and the user won't be able to enable them.</translation>

For example, if the machine name is <ph name="MACHINE_NAME_EXAMPLE" />, then <ph name="MACHINE_NAME_VARIABLE_EXAMPLE" /> would be replaced by the four characters starting after the sixth position, i.e. <ph name="MACHINE_NAME_PART_EXAMPLE" />. Note that the position is zero-based.

      This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

      In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met:
      1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.
      2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
      3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

      A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the '/' character and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognised hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is 'sha256'.

      If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</translation>

      The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such
      as '*.example.com') for which security restrictions on insecure origins
      will not apply.

      The intent is to allow organisations to whitelist origins for legacy
      applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for
      internal web development so that their developers can test out features
      requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging
      server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labelled
      'Not Secure' in the omnibox.

      Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the
      command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a
      comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will

      If the policy is set to 'Disable browser sign-in' then the user cannot sign in to the browser and use account-based services. In this case, browser level features like Chrome sync cannot be used and will be unavailable. If the user was signed in and the policy is set to 'Disabled' they will be signed out the next time that they run Chrome, but their local profile data like bookmarks, passwords, etc. will be preserved. The user will still be able to sign in to and use Google web services like Gmail.

      If the policy is set to 'Enable browser sign-in', then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser and is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means that the user's account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Chrome sync will be turned on by default; the user must separately opt in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Chrome sync, use the 'SyncDisabled' policy.

      If the policy is set to 'Force browser sign-in' the user is presented with an account selection dialogue and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. By default this turns on Chrome sync for the account, except for the case when sync was disabled by the domain admin or via the 'SyncDisabled' policy. The default value of BrowserGuestModeEnabled will be set to false. Note that existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy. For more information, see help centre article: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7572556. This option does not support Linux and will fall back to 'Enable browser sign-in' if used.
