# Perf Regression Sheriffing

The perf regression sheriff tracks performance regressions in Chrome's
continuous integration tests. Note that a [different
rotation](http://goto.google.com/perf-bot-health-sheriffs) has been created to ensure the builds and
tests stay green, so the perf regression sheriff role is now entirely focused
on performance.

Key responsibilities include:

    * Addressing bugs that need attention
    * Follow up on Performance Regressions
    * Give Feedback on our Infrastructure

For more information on how these responsibilities, how to swap shifts and more,
please see [Perf Regression
Sheriffs](http://goto.google.com/chrome-perf-regression-sheriffing)
