    Logs when a user action triggers a command in the bookmark manager. Commands
    can be triggered by keyboard shortcuts, menu items or other buttons in the

    Revised in M-76 when the &quot;Open (double click/enter)&quot; bucket was
    split into two separate buckets, one for bookmarks and one for folders.

    This histogram is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
