caption: Report device users
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset has enrolled devices report the list of device users that signed in recently.

  Setting the policy to Disabled means enrolled devices don't report the list of users.

  When <ph name="DEVICE_EPHEMERAL_USERS_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeviceEphemeralUsersEnabled</ph> is enabled, <ph name="REPORT_DEVICE_USERS_POLICY_NAME">ReportDeviceUsers</ph> is ignored and will always be disabled.
