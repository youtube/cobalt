{} coerces to a string - so no match, but not a type error:
Expecting exception from db.transaction({})
PASS Exception was thrown.

Overriding the default string coercion makes these work:
db.transaction({toString:function(){return 'a';}})
db.transaction([{toString:function(){return 'a';}}])
... but you still need to specify a real store:

PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is DOMException.NOT_FOUND_ERR
PASS ename is 'NotFoundError'
Exception message: Failed to execute 'transaction' on 'IDBDatabase': One of the specified object stores was not found.

PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is DOMException.NOT_FOUND_ERR
PASS ename is 'NotFoundError'
Exception message: Failed to execute 'transaction' on 'IDBDatabase': One of the specified object stores was not found.
