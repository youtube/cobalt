The DOM Distiller component contains code for an experimental prototype for
distilling the core part of a web page.

To enable this feature, use the command line flag --enable-dom-distiller.
It may also help to use a new user profile --user-data-dir=<directory>

The DOM Distiller is a layered component. See:
http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/layered-components-design

Folder structure:

  core/   contains the business logic of the component.
  webui/  contains the WebUI code and resources for the debug page.
