Git Setup
=========

This tutorial also uses a revision control program called
`git <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>`_.
In order to commit to a git repository,
you need to set up your identity.

Run these commands (with your info) to setup your `~/.gitconfig`
for use::

  git config --global user.name "John Doe"
  git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
