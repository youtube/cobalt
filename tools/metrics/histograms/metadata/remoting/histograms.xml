<histogram name="Remoting.Host.ChromeOs.AudioStream.AudioPlaybackMode"

  <summary>
    Records the audio playback mode requested when starting an audio stream on
    the host device for a CRD session in CrOS.

  <owner>cros-edu-eng@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Recorded once whenever the CRAS AudioManager reports a fatal audio stream
    error to AudioHelperChromeOsImpl::OnError() during a CRD session in CrOS. It
    is recorded only when an error occurs, so to determine the overall error
    rate against the total number of streaming attempts, refer to the
    success/failure metric `Remoting.Host.ChromeOs.AudioStream.StartResult`.
