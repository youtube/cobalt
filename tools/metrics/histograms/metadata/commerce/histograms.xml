    can be provided locally. This histogram is available on any platform where
    the shopping service's product info API is enabled and is recorded only

    Records the amount of time spent executing the on-page local extraction for
    extracting product info. This metric will only be recorded if the on-page
    local extraction executes successfully and the page that ran for is still in
    an active tab. This metric will help us identify possible performance
    regressions as we improve the extraction heuristics. This metric is recorded
    from the browser side which means it includes compiling and the other prep
    work done before the script is actually run on the page.
