default: true
desc: "When enabled the <ph name=\"PRODUCT_NAME\">BackForwardCache</ph> feature allows\
  \ the use of the back-forward cache. When navigating away from a page, its current\
  \ state (document tree, script, etc.) may be preserved in the back-forward cache.\
  \ If the browser navigates back to the page, the page may be restored from the back-forward\
  \ cache and displayed in the state it was in before being cached.\n\n          This\
  \ feature might cause issues for some websites that do not expect this caching.\
  \ In particular, some websites depend on the \"<ph name=\"UNLOAD_HANDLER_NAME\"\
  >unload</ph>\" event being dispatched when the browser navigates away from the page.\
  \ The \"<ph name=\"UNLOAD_HANDLER_NAME\">unload</ph>\" event will not be dispatched\
  \ if the page enters the back-forward cache.\n\n          If this policy is set\
  \ to enabled or not set,\n          the <ph name=\"PRODUCT_NAME\">BackForwardCache</ph>\
  \ feature will be enabled.\n\n          If this policy is set to disabled then the\
  \ feature will be force disabled.\n          "
