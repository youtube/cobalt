caption: Enable remote attestation for the device
deprecated: true
default: false
desc: |-
  This policy was removed in M121. It served to enable and disable Remote Attestation for the device but Remote Attestation has been enabled by default.

  Setting the policy to Enabled allows remote attestation for the device. A certificate is automatically generated and uploaded to the Device Management Server.

  Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means no certificate is generated and calls to the <ph name="ENTERPRISE_PLATFORM_KEYS_API">Enterprise Platform Keys API</ph> fail.
