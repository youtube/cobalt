The season concludes with a twelve-team tournament used to determine the teams to play in the Super Bowl. The tournament brackets are made up of six teams
from each of the league's two conferences, the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC), following the end of the
16-game regular season:
The four division champions from each conference (the team in each division with the best regular season won-lost-tied record), which are seeded one through
four based on their regular season won-lost-tied record (tie-breaker rules may apply).
Two wild card qualifiers from each conference (those non-division champions with the conference's best record, i.e. the best won-lost-tied percentages, with
    a series of tie-breaking rules in place in the event that there are teams with the same number of wins and losses[4]), which are seeded five and six.
<p style="font-size: 5em;">
In each conference, the #3 and #6 seeded teams, and the #4 and #5 seeds, face each other during the first round of the playoffs, dubbed the Wild Card
Playoffs (the league in recent years has also used the term Wild Card Weekend). The #1 and #2 seeds from each conference receive a bye in the first round,
         which entitles these teams to automatically advance to the second round, the Divisional Playoff games, to face the winning teams from the first
         round. In round two, the #1 seeded team always plays the lowest surviving seed in their conference. And in any given playoff game, whoever has the
         higher seed gets the home field advantage (i.e. the game is held at the higher seed's home field).
         The two surviving teams from the Divisional Playoff games meet in Conference Championship games, with the winners of those contests going on to face
         one another in the Super Bowl in a game located at a neutral venue that is usually either indoors or in a warm-weather locale. The designated "home
         team" alternates year to year between the conferences. In Super Bowl XLIV, the AFC Champion was the "home" team.
         [edit]Pro Bowl
         The Pro Bowl, the league's all-star game, has been traditionally held on the weekend after the Super Bowl. The game was played at various venues
         before being held at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii for 30 consecutive seasons from 1980 to 2009.
         However, the 2010 Pro Bowl was played at Sun Life Stadium, the home stadium of the Miami Dolphins and host site of Super Bowl XLIV, on January 31,
         the first time ever that the Pro Bowl was played before the championship game. The 2011 and 2012 games will return to Honolulu.</p>
