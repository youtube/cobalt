"""Lightweight utility to simplify resolving stack traces and crashes.

This tool supports three different formats for crashes and stack traces, but can
easily be expanded for addition cases. Examples of current formats are as
follows:

  Address Sanitizer
    #1 0x7fdc59bbaa6b  (<unknown module>)

  Cobalt
    <unknown> [0x7efcdf1fd52b]

  Raw
    0x7efcdf1fd52b

  GDB
    #1  0x742a51b6 in ?? () from /home/pi/content/app/cobalt/lib/libcobalt.so


The results of the symbolizer will only be included if it was able to find the
name of the symbol, and it does not appear to be malformed. The only exception
is when the line was matched with the |_RAW| regular expression in which case it
will always output the results of the symbolizer.
