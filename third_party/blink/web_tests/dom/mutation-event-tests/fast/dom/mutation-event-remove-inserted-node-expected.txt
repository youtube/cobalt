CONSOLE WARNING: Listener added for a synchronous 'DOMNodeInserted' DOM Mutation Event. This event type is deprecated (https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#legacy-event-types) and work is underway to remove it from this browser. Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a risk of future incompatibility. Consider using MutationObserver instead.
This test verifies that a mutation event that removes inserted nodes from the document doesn't crash upon the insertion of a new node into the document.

PASS: You didn't crash.
