// A `Suggestion` may have additional UI items that a user can interact with.
// Examples include refresh buttons or feedback buttons.
// `SuggestionButtonAction` is a type that allows the
// `AutofillSuggestionController` and the `AutofillSuggestionDelegate` to
// differentiate between different actions if a single `Suggestion` has more
// than one such action.
//
// Example:
// If a `Suggestion` wants to show downvote and upvote buttons, the handling
// logic (e.g. inside `AutofillExternalDelegate`) needs to be able to
// differentiate between the buttons that were clicked. To do that, one would do
// the following:
// - Define an action type, e.g.
//   enum class kMySuggestionButtonAction { kUpvote, kDownvote };
// - Add the type as a variant to `SuggestionButtonAction`.
