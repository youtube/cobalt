[FAIL] [maxPool2d] Test maxPool2d with data type int32
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'maxPool2d' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int32 for argument input, must be one of [float32, float16]."
[FAIL] [maxPool2d] Test maxPool2d with data type uint32
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint32 for input operand named 'input', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [maxPool2d] Test maxPool2d with data type int8
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int8 for input operand named 'input', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [maxPool2d] Test maxPool2d with data type uint8

[FAIL] [averagePool2d] Throw if the input data type is not floating point
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int64 for input operand named 'input', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [l2Pool2d] Throw if the input data type is not floating point
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint8 for input operand named 'input', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
