caption: Enable Safe Browsing Extended Reporting
default: null
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled turns on <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>'s Safe Browsing Extended Reporting, which sends some system information and page content to Google servers to help detect dangerous apps and sites.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means reports are never sent.

        If you set this policy, users can't change it. If not set, users can decide whether to send reports or not.

        See more about Safe Browsing ( https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing ).
