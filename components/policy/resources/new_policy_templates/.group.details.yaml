# This file will be used to set the caption and description of a policy group.
# A policy group is a list of policies that apply to the same realm. This is
# used mostly for documentation and every policy should be in a group.
# To create a new policy group, simply create a directory under
# `components/policy/resources/templates/policy_definitions` with the name of
# the policy group, then copy this file there and update the caption and
# description.
# Note: Nested policy groups are not supported.
