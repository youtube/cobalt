The extension_signed_by_webstore.crx package must be a one signed by WebStore,
in order for the extension to have the expected ID which is whitelisted in
Chrome - "ngjobkbdodapjbbncmagbccommkggmnj".

This extension is primarily intended to be used for the manual testing of the
extensions on the Chrome OS sign-in screen.

In case a new version of the test extension has to be published on WebStore,
please reach out to the managed-devices@ mailing list.
