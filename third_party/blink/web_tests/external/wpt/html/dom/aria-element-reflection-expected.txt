This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS aria-activedescendant element reflection
PASS If the content attribute is set directly, the IDL attribute getter always returns the first element whose ID matches the content attribute.
PASS Setting the IDL attribute to an element which is not the first element in DOM order with its ID causes the content attribute to be an empty string
PASS Setting an element reference that crosses into a shadow tree is disallowed, but setting one that is in a shadow inclusive ancestor is allowed.
FAIL aria-errormessage assert_equals: expected (string) "" but got (object) null
FAIL ariaErrorMessageElement is not defined assert_false: expected false got true
PASS aria-details
PASS Deleting a reflected element should return null for the IDL attribute and the content attribute will be empty.
PASS Changing the ID of an element doesn't lose the reference.
PASS Reparenting an element into a descendant shadow scope hides the element reference.
PASS Reparenting referenced element cannot cause retargeting of reference.
PASS Element reference set in invalid scope remains intact throughout move to valid scope.
FAIL aria-labelledby. assert_equals: check idl attribute caching after parsing expected [Element node <div id="billingElement">Billing</div>, Element node <div id="nameElement">Name</div>] but got [Element node <div id="billingElement">Billing</div>, Element node <div id="nameElement">Name</div>]
PASS aria-controls.
PASS aria-describedby.
PASS aria-flowto.
PASS aria-owns.
PASS shadow DOM behaviour for FrozenArray element reflection.
PASS Moving explicitly set elements across shadow DOM boundaries.
PASS Moving explicitly set elements around within the same scope, and removing from the DOM.
PASS Reparenting.
PASS Attaching element reference before it's inserted into the DOM.
PASS Cross-document references and moves.
PASS Adopting element keeps references.
FAIL Caching invariant different attributes. assert_equals: Caching invariant for ariaControlsElements expected [Element node <div id="cachingInvariantElement1"></div>, Element node <div id="cachingInvariantElement2"></div>] but got [Element node <div id="cachingInvariantElement1"></div>, Element node <div id="cachingInvariantElement2"></div>]
FAIL Caching invariant different elements. assert_equals: Caching invariant for ariaDescribedByElements in one elemnt expected [Element node <div id="cachingInvariantElement1"></div>, Element node <div id="cachingInvariantElement2"></div>] but got [Element node <div id="cachingInvariantElement1"></div>, Element node <div id="cachingInvariantElement2"></div>]
Harness: the test ran to completion.
