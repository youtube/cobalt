Description:
This directory contains models downloaded from https://tfhub.dev/ under its
Apache license. These models are not built into Chromium and are only used as
testdata.

Uploading New Models:
  1. Put all the models you want uploaded (including existing models to keep) in
  the existing //third_party/tfhub_models/models directory.

  2. `cd` to //third_party/tfhub_models.

  3. Run the following commands:
  ```
  tar -czf models.tar.gz models/*
  sha1sum models.tar.gz | awk '{print $1}' > models.tar.gz.sha1
  ```

  4. Upload the tarball to the cloud storage bucket:
  ```
  upload_to_google_storage.py --bucket chromium-tfhub-models models.tar.gz
  ```

  5. Overwrite chromium's sha1 models.tar.gz.sha1 file with the new one.

Models:
  Please keep this list and BUILD.gn up to date when new files are added to the
  Cloud Storage Bucket.

  * lite-model_universal-sentence-encoder-qa-ondevice_1.tflite - A TFLite
  Support compatible embedding model trained on Q&A text, pulled from
  https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/universal-sentence-encoder-qa-ondevice/1.
  Requires sentencepiece tokenization to be built into Chrome, which is not
  currently supported. See also https://crrev.com/c/4722355.

  * rehead_embedding_from_mobilebert.tflite - A TFLite Support compatible
  embedding model which was adapted from this BERT model,
  https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/lite-model/mobilebert/1/metadata/1. The base
  model was re-headed to expose the embedding layer.
