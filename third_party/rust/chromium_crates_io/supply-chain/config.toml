Bumped up the exemption to 2.7.1 when updating the crates.  When removing
the exemptions in the future we may want to look at the notes in cl/568617493
but even with those notes a review of the whole crate (rather than just the
delta) may be needed for `ub-risk-2`.

Bumped up the exemption to 2.7.2 in April 2024.  The delta was relatively small
and straightfoward (focusing on `target_feature = \"simd128\"`).  Note that an
unfinished audit of 2.7.1 has been started at https://crrev.com/c/5367005 and
I hear that Fuchsia has also been working on reviewing 2.7.1 (so we should check
later if maybe we can just import their audit).
