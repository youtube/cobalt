FAIL CloseWatchers created without user activation, but close()d via user activation, fires cancel promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL CloseWatchers created without user activation, but close()d via user activation, fires cancel, which can be preventDefault()ed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL CloseWatchers created without user activation, but closed via a close signal after user activation, fires cancel promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL CloseWatchers created without user activation, but closed via a close signal after user activation, fires cancel, which can be preventDefault()ed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL Multiple CloseWatchers created without user activation close together (with no cancel) promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL Creating a CloseWatcher from user activation keeps it separate from the free CloseWatcher, but they don't fire cancel promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL Creating a CloseWatcher from user activation, and close()ing CloseWatchers with user activation, fires cancel promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL Creating a CloseWatcher from user activation, and closing CloseWatchers with a close signal after user activation, fires cancel promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL Multiple CloseWatchers created with user activation close in reverse order promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL 3 user activations let you have 3 + 1 = 4 ungrouped close watchers/0 cancel events promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL 3 user activations let you have 2 close watchers with 1 cancel event, even if the first cancel event is prevented promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL destroy()ing the free CloseWatcher allows a new free one to be created without user activation, and it receives the close signal promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL close()ing the free CloseWatcher allows a new free one to be created without user activation, and it receives the close signal promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL closing the free CloseWatcher via a close signal allows a new free one to be created without user activation, and it receives a second close signal promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL The second watcher can be the free watcher, if the first is created with user activation promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL The third watcher can be the free watcher, if the first two are created with user activation promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
