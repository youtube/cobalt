desc: "The <ph name=\"PRODUCT_NAME\">Get Image Descriptions from Google</ph>\n   \
  \       accessibility feature enables visually-impaired screen reader users to\n\
  \          get descriptions of unlabeled images on the web. Users who choose to\
  \ enable it\n          will have the option of using an anonymous Google service\
  \ to provide\n          automatic descriptions for unlabeled images they encounter\
  \ on the web.\n\n          If this feature is enabled, the content of images will\
  \ be sent to Google\n          servers in order to generate a description. No cookies\
  \ or other user\n          data is sent, and Google does not save or log any image\
  \ content.\n\n          If this policy is set to Enabled, the\n          <ph name=\"\
  PRODUCT_NAME\">Get Image Descriptions from Google</ph>\n          feature will be\
  \ enabled, though it will only affect users who are using a\n          screen reader\
  \ or other similar assistive technology.\n\n          If this policy is set to Disabled,\
  \ users will not have the option of enabling\n          the feature.\n\n       \
  \   If this policy is not set, user can choose to use this feature or not.\n   \
