caption: Allow wake locks
default: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset allows wake locks for power management. Extensions can request wake locks through the power management extension API and ARC apps.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means wake lock requests are ignored.
