    The percent dropped frame is calculated for each sliding window of 1 second

    The sliding windows cover the duration of page-load (From start of page-load

    background). Note that this means that this metric will bias toward tabs
    that are closed more quickly, and might underreport tabs that remain open
    for a long duration.

    PercentDroppedFrames is measured by tracking the number of frames which were
    not displayed on screen out of the total number of frames expected to be
    produced and displayed. In other words, the lower this number is, the

    Tracks the percent of dropped frames for a sequence by aggregating all its
    animations and interactions, where a sequence is a series of frames produced
    which contain at least one of the animations/interactions. Such animations
    and interactions encompass: Compositor-thread animations; Main-thread
    animations; JS animations; scrolling; and pinch-gestures.

    PercentDroppedFrames is measured by tracking the number of frames which were
    not displayed on screen out of the total number of frames expected to be
    produced and displayed. In other words, the lower this number is, the
    smoother the experience.

    Note that this metric is reported only when there are a sufficient number of
    frames (&gt;= 100). If there are sequences with fewer frames, then these are
    aggregated until an additional sequence completes where there are (&gt;=
    100) frames available in total.

    This is a new implementation of the older
    Graphics.Smoothness.PercentDroppedFrames.AllInteractions metric.

    This histogram is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

    Tracks the percent of frames that missed the deadline for a particular

    PercentMissedDeadlineFrames is measured by tracking the number of frames

  <summary>
    Tracks the staleness value for each frame presentation for a particular
    sequence of frames (e.g. during scroll, animation, etc.). This is reported
    in various sub-metrics with suffixes describing the type of the sequence
    (e.g. TouchScroll etc.).

    Typically, a frame presentation is expected to last at least one vsync
    cycle, plus any number of additional vsync cycles if no updates are expected
    duration that time. If the presentation interval is prolonged due to reasons
    other than listed above, then that prolonged portion will be considered
    staleness.

    Note that the reporting of this metric occurs as soon as a frame is
    presented, and is not affected by the length of the frame sequence.
