# Developing web standards within Chromium

The [Chromium process for launching
features](https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features) requires that
web-exposed features go through (though not always complete) a public
standardization process.

We provide a [specification mentorship
program](https://www.chromium.org/blink/spec-mentors) to help you go through
this process.

If you notice misbehavior in a standardization venue, see their [codes of
conduct](conduct.md).
