"""Script to extract edits from clang spanification tool output.

The edits have the following format:
    ...
    {lhs_node1}@{rhs_node1}
    {node_n}
    {lhs_node2}@{rhs_node2}
    ...
    ...
Where lhs_node, rhs_node, and node_n represent a node's text representation
generated using the spanification tool's Node::ToString() function.

The string representation has the following format:
`{is_buffer\,r:::<file path>:::<offset>:::<length>
:::<replacement text>\,include-user-header:::<file path>:::-1:::-1
:::<include text>\,size_info_available\,is_data_change\,is_deref_node}`

where `is_buffer`,`size_info_available`, `is_data_change` and `is_deref_node`
are booleans represented as  0 or 1.

extract_edits.py takes input that is concatenated from multiple tool
invocations and extract just the edits with the following steps:
1- Construct the adjacency list of nodes
   (a pairs of nodes represents an edge in the directed graph)

2- Determine whether size info is available for a given buffer node.

3- Run `DFS` starting from buffer nodes whose size info is available and emit
   edits for reachable nodes.

4- Adapt dereference expressions and add data changes where necessary.

extract_edits.py would then emit the following output:
    <edit1>
    <edit2>
    <edit3>
    ...
Where the edit is either a replacement or an include directive.

For more details about how the tool works, see the doc here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hUPe21CDdbT6_YFHl03KWlcZqhNIPBAfC-5N5DDY2OE/
