caption: Allow users to manage installed client certificates.
default: 0
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to 'All' (value 0) or leaving it unset lets users manage certificates. Setting the policy to 'None' (value 2) means users can only view (not manage) certificates.

        Setting the policy to 'UserOnly' (value 1) lets users manage user certificates, but not device-wide certificates.
