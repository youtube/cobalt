A key of size smaller than 2048 bits can be used with RS256, RS384, RS512 JWK algorithms.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS key.algorithm.modulusLength is 1024
PASS key.algorithm.modulusLength is 1024
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
