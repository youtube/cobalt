Description:
Our custom configuration options are defined in pngusr.h. This was previously
called mozpngconf.h, which was copied from Mozilla and modified by Apple (hence
the wk_* names).

Updated to 1.2.45, no changes to the source files but all unneeded files
stripped.

- One custom patch for bug 112822, to be sent upstream.
- Also a signedness condition from upstream relating to the above, bug 116162.
