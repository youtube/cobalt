# here only if it meets the following constraints:
# (1) It is *necessary* to use the file to consume Device Gamepad (the
# current files define structs that are used as a consistent interpretation of
# shared memory by the Device Gamepad and its clients).
# (2) The file has no dependencies on the STL or Chromium code and will not
# grow them over time (the current files are POD structs and will necessarily
# stay that way due to their above-described purpose).
# Consult {platform-architecture-dev, services-dev}@chromium.org in the case
# of any uncertainty.
