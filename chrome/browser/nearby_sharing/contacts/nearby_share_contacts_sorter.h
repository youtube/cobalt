//  - person name or email address if name is empty (primary),
//  - email, even if this is also used as the primary (secondary),
//  - phone number (tertiary),
//  - contact record id (last resort; should always be unique).
//
// This sorted order is unique for a given |locale|, presuming every element of
// |contacts| has a unique ContactRecord::id(). The ordering between fields is
// locale-dependent. For example, 'Å' will be sorted with these 'A's for
// US-based sorting, whereas 'Å' will be sorted after 'Z' for Sweden-based
// sorting, because 'Å' comes after 'Z' in the Swedish alphabet. By default,
// |locale| is inferred from system settings.
