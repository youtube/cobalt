This directory attempts to test overflow specifications:
[css-overflow-3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-overflow-3/),
and [css-overflow-4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-overflow-4/)

Overflow is observed by Element.scrollWidth and Element.scrollHeight.

These tests do not test scrollbar visibility or size, because the spec does not dictate scrollbar appearance.
