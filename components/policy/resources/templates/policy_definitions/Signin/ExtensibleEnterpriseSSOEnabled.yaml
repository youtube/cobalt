caption: Enable extensible Enterprise SSO support
desc: |-
  Configures automatic user sign-in for accounts with authentication providers by an Enterprise SSO Extension.

  By setting this policy to 1 (<ph name="POLICY_VALUE_ENABLED">Enabled</ph>) or leaving it unset, authentication providers with an SSO extension on the device will use that extension to authenticate users trying to sign in.

  By setting this policy to 0 (<ph name="POLICY_VALUE_DISABLED">Disabled</ph>), automatic sign-in as described above is disabled.

  This feature is available starting in MacOS Catalina.

  Note: This policy doesn't apply to Incognito or Guest modes.
