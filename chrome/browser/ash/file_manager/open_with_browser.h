// app installed, it will try to launch the app instead of a browser.

// Opens the file specified by |file_path| with the browser for
// |profile|. This function takes care of the following intricacies:
//
// - If there is no active browser window, open it.
// - If the file is a Drive hosted document, the hosted document will be
//   opened in the browser by extracting the right URL for the file.
// - If the file is a Drive hosted document, check if there is an installed app
// that can handle the document type, if it can launch the app instead.
// - If the file is on Drive, the file will be downloaded from Drive as
//   needed.
//
// Returns false if failed to open. This happens if the file type is unknown.
