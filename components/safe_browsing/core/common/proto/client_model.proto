// This protocol buffer represents a machine learning model that is used in
// client-side phishing detection (in Chrome).  The client extracts a set
// of features from every website the user visits.  Extracted features map
// feature names to floating point values (e.g., PageSecureLinksFreq -> 0.9).
//
// To compute the phishing score (i.e., the probability that the website is
// phishing) a scorer will simply compute the sum of all rule scores for a
// given set of extracted features.  The score of a particular rule corresponds
// to the product of all feature values that are part of the rule times the
// rule weight.  If a feature has no value (i.e., is not part of the extracted
// features) its value will be set to zero.  The overall score is computed
// by summing up all the rule scores.  This overall score is a logodds and can
// be converted to a probability like this:
// p = exp(logodds) / (exp(logodds) + 1).
//
// To make it harder for phishers to reverse engineer our machine learning model
// all the features in the model are hashed with a sha256 hash function.  The
// feature extractors also hash the extracted features before scoring happens.
