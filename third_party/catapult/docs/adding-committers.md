# Adding contributors

Admins (sullivan, benhenry, nednguyen) can add contributors to the project.
There are three steps:

1.  Check that the person has signed the Contributor License Agreement.
    You can check [here](http://go/check-cla). If they have not signed, please
    redirect them to [this page][cla] and wait for them to sign before adding.
2.  Add the person's github account to the [catapult] team.
3.  Add the person's email to the [commit queue list].

Because there is no API to retrieve a person's GitHub ID from their email
address or vice versa, we cannot automate this into one step.
