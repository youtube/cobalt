Main script that pulls, builds, tags, and pushes the corresponding Docker image
for a given platform. Then it reuses the image for a Cobalt build.

When it fails to build the image, a prebuilt failure image placeholder is
downloaded and reuploaded as the resulting image. Other Kokoro jobs that detect
this image will fail when the image is run.
