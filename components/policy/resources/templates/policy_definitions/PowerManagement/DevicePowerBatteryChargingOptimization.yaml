caption: Battery Charging Optimization
desc: |-
  Battery health can be affected by factors like frequent full charges and extended charging durations. This policy provides three options to optimize charging behavior and mitigate these factors, ultimately prolonging battery lifespan.

  Leaving the policy unset - Users can use Adaptive Charging toggle button to enable/disable Adaptive Charging.

  Setting the policy to 1 - Standard or leaving it unset, the battery charges normally to 100%. This disables adaptive and limited charging.

  Setting the policy to 2 - Adaptive, the device learns your charging habits and delays charging to 100% until necessary. This helps prolong battery health.

  Setting the policy to 3 - Limited, the battery charges only to around 80% to maximize its lifespan.

  If the <ph name="DEVICE_POWER_BATTERY_CHARGING_OPTIMIZATION_POLICY_NAME">DevicePowerBatteryChargingOptimization</ph> policy is set, it takes precedence over the <ph name="DEVICE_POWER_ADAPTIVE_CHARGING_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DevicePowerAdaptiveChargingEnabled</ph> policy.

  If the <ph name="DEVICE_POWER_BATTERY_CHARGING_OPTIMIZATION_POLICY_NAME">DevicePowerBatteryChargingOptimization</ph> policy is not set, then the <ph name="DEVICE_POWER_ADAPTIVE_CHARGING_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DevicePowerAdaptiveChargingEnabled</ph> policy controls whether the adaptive charging feature is enabled or disabled.

  <ph name="DEVICE_POWER_ADAPTIVE_CHARGING_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DevicePowerAdaptiveChargingEnabled</ph> will be deprecated.
