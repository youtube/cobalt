# IWYU (include-what-you-use) mapping file.
#
# This mapping is specific to Blink, as the include path prefix might be
# different in other libraries. For instance, blink includes V8 libraies via
# "v8/include", but V8 includes its own headers directly. This mapping has been
# tested agasint "third_party/blink/renderer/modules/canvas", but could be
# extended to other Blink folders.
