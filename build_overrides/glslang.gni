# Chromium uses glslang for ANGLE's Vulkan backend.
#
# Note that the latter is not shipped to end users. For ANGLE, glslang is tailored to support only
# what ANGLE needs. This significantly reduces the binary size of ANGLE as well as glslang's startup
# time. This flag makes glslang strip features that are not used by ANGLE.
