// Factory that manages creation of CertDbInitializer. The initialization is
// handled differently depending on the environment:
// * On real ChromeOS devices with TPMs:
// ** if the user is affiliated: CertDbInitializer is automatically
// created right after its profile is created. It receives a path to software
// cert database and slot IDs for Chaps from Ash and uses them.
// ** if the user is not affiliated: TODO(b/197082753): not officially supported
// yet, handled as if there's no TPM.
// * In emulated environments (e.g. when running ChromeOS on Linux) and in the
// future on ChromeOS without TPMs: Same as real ChromeOS, but Ash only sends
// the software database path.
// * In browsertests: CertDbInitializer is not created by default because it
// requires crosapi mojo interface. It is configured through the
// `SetCreateWithBrowserContextForTesting()` method. This can be overridden by
// individual tests or they can create their own instances of the service.
// * In unittests: CertDbInitializer is not created by default (see
// `ServiceIsNULLWhileTesting()`).
