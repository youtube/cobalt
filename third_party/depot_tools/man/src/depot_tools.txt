NAME
----
depot_tools - A collection of tools for dealing with Chromium development.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Chromium depot_tools suite contains many tools to assist/augment the
Chromium development environment. The tools may be downloaded by checking
out the link:{sys3:git config remote.origin.url}[git repository].

There are two primary categories of tools. Some of these tools are 'essential'
to the development flow, in the sense that you cannot successfully develop
Chromium without them.

Other tools are merely 'helper' tools. Not required, but they can substantially
ease the development workflow.

A listing of both categories of tools follows.
