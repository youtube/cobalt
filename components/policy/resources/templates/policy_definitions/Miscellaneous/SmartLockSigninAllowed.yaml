caption: Allow Smart Lock Signin to be used.
default_for_enterprise_users: false
desc: |-
  If this setting is enabled, users will be allowed to sign into their account with Smart Lock. This is more permissive than usual Smart Lock behavior which only allows users to unlock their screen.

        If this setting is disabled, users will not be allowed to use Smart Lock Signin.

        If this policy is left not set, the default is not allowed for enterprise-managed users and allowed for non-managed users.
