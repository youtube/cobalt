This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS idl_test setup
PASS idl_test validation
PASS Partial interface Performance: original interface defined
PASS Partial interface Performance: valid exposure set
PASS Partial interface Performance: member names are unique
PASS Partial dictionary PerformanceObserverInit: original dictionary defined
PASS Partial dictionary PerformanceObserverInit: member names are unique
PASS Partial interface Performance[2]: member names are unique
PASS PerformanceEventTiming interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS EventCounts interface: existence and properties of interface object
FAIL EventCounts must be primary interface of performance.eventCounts assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
FAIL Stringification of performance.eventCounts assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
FAIL EventCounts interface: performance.eventCounts must not have property "undefined" Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'undefined' in undefined
PASS Performance interface: member eventCounts
PASS Performance interface: member interactionCount
PASS Performance interface: performance must not have property "eventCounts"
PASS Performance interface: performance must not have property "interactionCount"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
