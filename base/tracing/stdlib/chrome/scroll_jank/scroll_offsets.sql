-- This file creates two public views:
--     - chrome_scroll_input_offsets and
--     - chrome_presented_scroll_offsets
--
-- These views store the pixel deltas and offsets for (respectively) all chrome
-- scroll inputs (coalesced and not coalesced), and for chrome presented frames
-- (not coalesced), along with the associated timestamp, and id.
--
-- Raw deltas are recorded as changes in pixel positions along the y-axis of a
-- screen, and are scaled to the viewport size. The corresponding trace event
-- for this is TranslateAndScaleWebInputEvent. These are the deltas for all
-- chrome scroll inputs.
--
-- For presented frames, the delta is calculated from the visual offset,
-- recorded once the input has been processed, in the
-- InputHandlerProxy::HandleGestureScrollUpdate_Result event. These values are
-- also scaled to the screen size.
--
-- Offsets are calculated by summing all of the deltas, ordered by timestamp.
-- For a given input/frame, the offset is the sum of its corresponding delta and
-- all previous deltas.
--
--
-- All values required for calculating deltas and offsets are recorded at
-- various stages of input processing, and are unified by a single
-- scroll_update_id value, recorded as scroll_deltas.trace_id in each event.
