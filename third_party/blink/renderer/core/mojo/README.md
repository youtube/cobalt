# Mojo JavaScript System API
This document is a subset of the [Mojo documentation](/mojo/README.md).

The JavaScript system API exposes the capabilities to create message pipes, data
pipes, shared buffers and watchers. The API is defined using Web IDL. You could
find the IDL files [here](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/blink/renderer/core/mojo/)

Please refer to the low-level [C system API](/mojo/public/c/system/README.md)
for more detailed documentation of equivalent methods.

TODO: Examples.
