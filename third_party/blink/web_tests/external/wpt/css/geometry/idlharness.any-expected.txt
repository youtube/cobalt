[FAIL] DOMRect interface: legacy window alias
  assert_equals: self.SVGRect should be the same value as self.DOMRect expected function "function DOMRect() { [native code] }" but got function "function SVGRect() { [native code] }"
[FAIL] DOMMatrix interface: legacy window alias
  assert_equals: self.SVGMatrix should be the same value as self.DOMMatrix expected function "function DOMMatrix() { [native code] }" but got function "function SVGMatrix() { [native code] }"
