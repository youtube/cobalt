//
// When the main executable is updated on disk while the application is running,
// and the offset of the Mach-O image at the main executable's path changes from
// the offset that was determined when the executable was loaded, SecCode ceases
// to be able to work with the executable. This may be triggered when the
// product is updated on disk but the application has not yet relaunched. This
// affects SecCodeCopySelf and SecCodeCopyGuestWithAttributes. Bugs are evident
// even when validation (SecCodeCheckValidity) is not attempted.
//
// Practically, this is only a concern for fat (universal) files, because the
// offset of a Mach-O image in a thin (single-architecture) file is always 0.
// The branded product always ships a fat executable, and because some uses of
// SecCode are in OS code beyond Chrome's control, an effort is made to freeze
// the geometry of the branded (BUILDFLAG(GOOGLE_CHROME_BRANDING))
// for-public-release (defined(OFFICIAL_BUILD)) main executable.
//
// The fat file is produced by installer/mac/universalizer.py. The x86_64 slice
// always precedes the arm64 slice: lipo, as used by universalizer.py, always
// places the arm64 slice last. See Xcode 12.0
// https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/cctools/blob/cctools-973.0.1/misc/lipo.c#L2672
// cmp_qsort, used by create_fat at #L962. universalizer.py ensures that the
// first slice in the file is located at a constant offset (16kB since
// 98.0.4758.80), but if the first slice's size changes, it can affect the
// offset of the second slice, the arm64 one, triggering SecCode-related bugs
// for arm64 users across updates.
//
// As quite a hack of a workaround, the offset of the arm64 slice within the fat
// main executable is influenced to land at the desired location by introducing
// padding to the x86_64 slice that precedes it. The arm64 slice needs to remain
// at offset 272kB (since 106.0.5249.61). The signed x86_64 slice has size
// 260704 bytes (including 68kB of padding) in 106.0.5249.61, but has grown
// since then, and before the introduction of any padding, would now be 194412
// bytes long. It needs to be padded to be in the range (245760, 262144] so that
// the arm64 slice that follows it begins at offset 272kB. To allow for the
// possibility of small-scale (up to +/-8kB) size changes, the target size for
// the padded x86_64 slice is 253952 bytes. To make up the 59540-byte
// difference, 56kB (57344 bytes) of padding is added to the x86_64 slice. to
// ensure that its size is stable, causing the arm64 slice to land where it
// needs to be when universalized. This padding needs to be added to the thin
// form of the x86_64 image before being fed to universalizer.py. Why 57344
// bytes and not 59540? To keep it an even multiple of linker pages (not machine
// pages: linker pages are 4kB for lld targeting x86_64 and 16kB for ld64
// targeting x86_64, but Chrome uses lld). In any case, I'll make up some of the
// 2196-byte difference with one more weird trick below.
//
// There are several terrible ways to insert this padding into the x86_64 image.
// Best would be something that considers the size of the x86_64 image without
// padding, and inserts the precise amount required. It may be possible to do
// this after linking, but the options that have been attempted so far were not
// successful. So this quick and very dirty 56kB buffer is added to increase the
// size of __TEXT,__const in a way that no tool could possibly see as suspicious
// after link time. The variable is marked with the "used" attribute to prevent
// the compiler from issuing warnings about the referenced variable, to prevent
// the compiler from removing it under optimization, and to set the
// S_ATTR_NO_DEAD_STRIP section attribute to prevent the linker from removing it
// under -dead_strip. Note that the standardized [[maybe_unused]] attribute only
// suppresses the warning, but does not prevent the compiler or linker from
// removing it.
//
// The introduction of this fixed 56kB of padding causes the unsigned linker
// output to grow by 56kB precisely, but the signed output will grow by slightly
// more. This is because the code signature's code directory contains SHA-1 and
// SHA-256 hashes of each 4kB code signing page (note, not machine pages or
// linker pages) in the image, adding 20 and 32 bytes each (macOS 12.0.1
// https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Security/blob/main/OSX/libsecurity_codesigning/lib/signer.cpp#L298
// Security::CodeSigning::SecCodeSigner::Signer::prepare). For the 56kB
// addition, the code signature grows by (56 / 4) * (20 + 32) = 728 bytes, thus
// the total size of the linker output grows by 56kB + 728 = 58072 bytes. It is
// not possible to control this any more granularly: if the buffer were sized at
// 56kB - 728 = 56616 bytes, it would either cause no change in the space
// allocated to the __TEXT segment (due to padding for alignment) or would cause
// the segment to shrink by a linker page (note, not a code signing or machine
// page) which would which would cause the linker output to shrink by the same
// amount and would be absolutely undesirable. Luckily, the net growth of 58072
// bytes is almost at the target of 59540. In any event, having the signed
// x86_64 slice sized at 252484 bytes instead of 253952 should not be a problem.
// So long as the size is in the proper 16kB range, the 16kB alignment for the
// arm64 slice that follows it in the fat file will cause it to appear at the
// desired 272kB.
//
// If the main executable has a significant change in size, this will need to be
// revised. Hopefully a more elegant solution will become apparent before that's
// required.
