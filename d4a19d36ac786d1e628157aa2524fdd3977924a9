We are tracking this issue internally though so that we can setup capabilities more faithfully later, so of course we would then address MIPS as well when it comes to that.\n\nWhile I would prefer omitting this for now, if we truly must enable this code, I would suggest then that you instead do, somewhere in this file:\n\n#if V8_HOST_ARCH_MIPS || V8_HOST_ARCH_MIPS64\n// Assume that if we\u0027re on a MIPS platform, we\u0027re on Linux.\n#define V8_OS_LINUX 1\n#endif\n\nthis way, we don\u0027t enable this block of code for non-MIPS platforms.",
