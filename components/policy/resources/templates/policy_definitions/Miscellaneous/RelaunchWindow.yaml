caption: Set the time interval for relaunch
desc: |-
  Specify a target time window for the end of the relaunch notification period.

        Users are notified of the need for a browser relaunch or device restart based on the <ph name="RELAUNCH_NOTIFICATION_POLICY_NAME">RelaunchNotification</ph> and <ph name="RELAUNCH_NOTIFICATION_PERIOD_POLICY_NAME">RelaunchNotificationPeriod</ph> policy settings. Browsers and devices are forcibly restarted at the end of the notification period when the <ph name="RELAUNCH_NOTIFICATION_POLICY_NAME">RelaunchNotification</ph> policy is set to 'Required'. This <ph name="RELAUNCH_WINDOW_POLICY_NAME">RelaunchWindow</ph> policy can be used to defer the end of the notification period so that it falls within a specific time window.

        If this policy is not set, the default target time window for <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> is between 2 AM and 4 AM. The default target time window for <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> is the whole day (i.e., the end of the notification period is never deferred).

        Note: Though the policy can accept multiple items in <ph name="ENTRIES_FIELD_NAME">entries</ph>, all but the first item are ignored.
        Warning: Setting this policy may delay application of software updates.
