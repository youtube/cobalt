// A WorkItem subclass that recursively copies a file system hierarchy from
// source path to destination path. It also creates all necessary intermediate
// paths of the destination path if they do not exist. The file system
// hierarchy could be a single file, or a directory.
// Under the cover CopyTreeWorkItem moves the destination path, if existing,
// to the temporary directory passed in, and then copies the source hierarchy
// to the destination location. During rollback the original destination
// hierarchy is moved back.
// NOTE: It is a best practice to ensure that the temporary directory is on the
// same volume as the destination path.  If this is not the case, the existing
// destination path is not moved, but rather copied, to the destination path.
// This will result in in-use files being left behind, as well as potentially
// losing ACLs or other metadata in the case of a rollback.
