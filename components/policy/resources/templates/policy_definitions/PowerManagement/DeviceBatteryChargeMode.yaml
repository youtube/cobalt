caption: Battery charge mode
desc: |-
  Unless <ph name="DEVICE_ADVANCED_BATTERY_CHARGE_MODE_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeviceAdvancedBatteryChargeModeEnabled</ph> is specified, which overrides <ph name="DEVICE_BATTERY_CHARGE_MODE_POLICY_NAME">DeviceBatteryChargeMode</ph>, then setting <ph name="DEVICE_BATTERY_CHARGE_MODE_POLICY_NAME">DeviceBatteryChargeMode</ph> specifies battery charge mode power management policy (if supported on the device). To extend battery life, the policy dynamically controls battery charging by minimizing stress and wear-out.

        Leaving the policy unset (if supported on the device) applies the standard battery charge mode, and users can't change it.

        Note: If Custom battery charge mode is selected, then also specify <ph name="DEVICE_BATTERY_CHARGE_CUSTOM_START_CHARGING_POLICY_NAME">DeviceBatteryChargeCustomStartCharging</ph> and <ph name="DEVICE_BATTERY_CHARGE_CUSTOM_STOP_CHARGING_POLICY_NAME">DeviceBatteryChargeCustomStopCharging</ph>.
