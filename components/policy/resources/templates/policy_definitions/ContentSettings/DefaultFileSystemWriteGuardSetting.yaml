caption: Control use of the File System API for writing
default: null
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to 3 lets websites ask for write access to files and directories in the host operating system's file system. Setting the policy to 2 denies access.

        Leaving it unset lets websites ask for access, but users can change this setting.
