// Observes CloudPolicyClient and CloudPolicyStore to trigger periodic policy
// fetches and issue retries on error conditions.
//
// Refreshing non-managed responses:
// - If there is a cached non-managed response, make sure to only re-query the
//   server after kUnmanagedRefreshDelayMs.
//  - NB: For existing policy, an immediate refresh is intentional.
//
// Refreshing on mobile platforms:
// - if no user is signed-in then the |client_| is never registered.
// - if the user is signed-in but isn't enterprise then the |client_| is
//   never registered.
// - if the user is signed-in but isn't registered for policy yet then the
//   |client_| isn't registered either; the UserPolicySigninService will try
//   to register, and OnRegistrationStateChanged() will be invoked later.
// - if the client is signed-in and has policy then its timestamp is used to
//   determine when to perform the next fetch, which will be once the cached
//   version is considered "old enough".
//
// If there is an old policy cache then a fetch will be performed "soon"; if
// that fetch fails then a retry is attempted after a delay, with exponential
// backoff. If those fetches keep failing then the cached timestamp is *not*
// updated, and another fetch (and subsequent retries) will be attempted
// again on the next startup.
//
// But if the cached policy is considered fresh enough then we try to avoid
// fetching again on startup; the Android logic differs from the desktop in
// this aspect.
