caption: Allowed Kerberos encryption types
desc: |-
  Setting the policy designates which encryption types are allowed when requesting Kerberos tickets from a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> server.

        Setting the policy to:

        * All allows the AES encryption types aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 and aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96, as well as the RC4 encryption type rc4-hmac. AES takes precedence if the server supports AES and RC4 encryption types.

        * Strong or leaving it unset allows only the AES types.

        * Legacy allows only the RC4 type. RC4 is insecure. It should only be needed in very specific circumstances. If possible, reconfigure the server to support AES encryption.
