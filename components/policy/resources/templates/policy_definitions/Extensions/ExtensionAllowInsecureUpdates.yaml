caption: Allow insecure algorithms in integrity checks on extension updates and installs
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> permits installation and updates for extensions hosted outside the Chrome Web Store, the content of which might only be minimally protected.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> won't permit fresh installation of (and updates to) such extensions. The policy has no effect in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> 78 and later.

        Leaving this policy unset means it is Enabled in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> 73 to 75, and Disabled in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> 76 and 77.
