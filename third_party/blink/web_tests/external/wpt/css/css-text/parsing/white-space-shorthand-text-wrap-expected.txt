This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] `text-wrap: balance` should be set
[PASS] `text-wrap` should not be affected by previous `white-space`
[FAIL] `white-space` should not overwrite previous `text-wrap-style: balance`
  assert_equals: expected "balance" but got "wrap"
[FAIL] `white-space` should overwrite previous `text-wrap-mode: nowrap`
  assert_equals: expected "balance" but got "wrap"
[PASS] `text-wrap` should not be affected by `white-space` on the parent
[FAIL] `white-space` should overwrite `text-wrap-mode` on the parent
  assert_equals: expected "balance" but got "wrap"
