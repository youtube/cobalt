// This class provides states to manage life cycle of a task and given below is
// how it is used by TaskGraphWorkQueue to process life cycle of a task.
// Task is in NEW state when it is created. When task is added to
// |ready_to_run_tasks| then its state is changed to SCHEDULED. Task can be
// canceled from NEW state (not yet scheduled to run) or from SCHEDULED state,
// when new ScheduleTasks() is triggered and its state is changed to CANCELED.
// When task is about to run it is added |running_tasks| and its state is
// changed to RUNNING. Once task finishes running, its state is changed to
// FINISHED. Both CANCELED and FINISHED tasks are added to |completed_tasks|.
