# This expectations file will disable tests for functionality which there are no
# plans to implement in any of the Android browsers.

# WebAuthn WPT tests use the WebAuthn WebDriver extension, which integrates
# with the WebAuthn implementation in //content. Android delegates to GMSCore
# for its WebAuthn implementation, so the WebDriver API isn't available, so
# these tests can't work.
