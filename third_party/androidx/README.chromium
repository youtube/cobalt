Description:
A gradle-specified repository for Androidx dependencies.

Where the snapshots come from:
* Snapshots originate from https://androidx.dev
* They are made into CIPD packages by this bot: https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/builders/ci/android-androidx-packager
* They are then rolled in by this autoroller: https://autoroll.skia.org/r/androidx-chromium
* Googlers can trigger manual runs: https://luci-scheduler.appspot.com/jobs/chromium/android-androidx-packager

Mapping snapshot version to git revision:
* The current version of the snapshot is written to VERSION.txt (sibling of this
  README, but does not appear in codesearch).
* Open the "BUILD_INFO" JSON file from https://androidx.dev/snapshots/builds for
  the given version, and search for the "platform/frameworks/support" entry.
  * That entry will have a "revision" field, which is the git revision the
    snapshot was created from.

How to add a new androidx library:
* Add the gradle entry for the desired target to build.gradle.template
* Do a trial run (downloads files locally):
    mv libs libs.bak && ./fetch_all_androidx.py
* Upload & submit your change to build.gradle.template
* Wait for android-androidx-packager to upload a new CIPD instance (linked above)
* Wait for androidx-chromium to roll the new package (linked above)

Local Modifications:
* Added the BuildCompat.java source to local_modification/ so that we can roll
  it manually and out-of-band with the rest of androidx. Use the
  update_source.sh script to pull in changes from androidx-main.

* Added a no-op version of androidx.window
* Pin androidx_recycleview_recycleview to avoid https://crbug.com/1421341.
