  Warning! This policy is deprecated, please use <ph name="CROS_GLS_POLICY_NAME">GoogleLocationServicesEnabled</ph> instead. <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> now has a system location toggle, which governs the entire system including <ph name="ANDROID_NAME">Android</ph>. The <ph name="ANDROID_NAME">Android</ph> toggle is now read-only and reflects the <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> location state.

  Unless the <ph name="DEFAULT_GEOLOCATION_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultGeolocationSetting</ph> policy is set to <ph name="BLOCK_GEOLOCATION_SETTING">BlockGeolocation</ph>, then setting <ph name="GLS_ENABLED">GoogleLocationServicesEnabled</ph> turns Google location services on during initial setup. Setting the policy to <ph name="GLS_DISABLED">GoogleLocationServicesDisabled</ph> or leaving it unset keeps location services off during setup.

  Setting policy to <ph name="GLS_UNDER_USER_CONTROL">GoogleLocationServicesUnderUserControl</ph> prompts users about whether or not to use Google location services. If they turn it on, <ph name="ANDROID_NAME">Android</ph> apps, <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> apps, websites, and system services use the services to search the device location and send anonymous location data to Google.

  After initial setup, users can turn Google location services on or off.
