    navigated away from the old page, such as modifications to storage,
    navigations, or sending/receiving postMessage.

    Note 2: We will not track actions taken when the unload event is currently

    Renderers should not be sending messages back to the browser for pages that

    When we are attempting to activate a prerendered page, we compare the
    prerendered page's NavigationRequest's headers with the incoming
    NavigationRequest's (called activation navigation). If they mismatch,
    PrerenderHost will post a task. The task scans the two headers, and will
    report a mismatching record if it detects any differences between them. It
    records the hashed number of a mismatching header, together with the
    mismatching reason: Missing in prerendering navigation, missing in
    activation navigation, or the values mismatch.

    Number of bytes transferred on the network for URLRequests (not including
    HTTP/TLS/TCP/IP overhead) for a prerender that was not used. All
    nostate-prefetch bytes are currently counted as wasted because it is hard to
    track byte use in HTTP cache.
