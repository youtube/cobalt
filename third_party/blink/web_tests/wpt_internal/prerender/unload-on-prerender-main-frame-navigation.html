This file cannot be upstreamed to WPT until:
* The test changes to use a method to trigger cancellation of prerendering that
  is guaranteed by the specification. Currently the test cancels prerendering
  by performing a main frame navigation after the initial prerendering
  navigation.
* `unload` event handling matches what the specification expects. The current
  specification expects that the unload event handler is never fired, and the
  test passes whether or not it is fired.
* `pageshow` and `pagehide` behaviors during prerendering is clearly defined
  in the specification. This test just checks current behaviors.
