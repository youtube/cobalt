  // Note that PushMessagingDispatcher::DoSubscribe() only looks at the web
  // manifest, so we list the manifest here.
  // However, this also means we cannot use PushMessaging from a service
  // worker which does not have an associated HTML page
  // (_generated_background_page.html).

  // TODO(lazyboy): We should probably look into improving this:
