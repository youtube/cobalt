/**
 * RebindServiceConnection is to update a bound process in the LRU of the ProcessList of
 * OomAdjuster.
 *
 * <p>`Context.updateServiceGroup()` requires application to rebind the process to apply the change.
 * Also rebinding a process moves the process to the more recent position in the ProcessList even
 * without `Context.updateServiceGroup()`.
 *
 * <p>This RebindServiceConnection is a workaround for 2 issues of rebinding ServiceConnection.
 *
 * <p>* Poorly differentiated concepts of a binding and a connection.
 *
 * <p>In the public API, a `ServiceConnection` uniquely identifies a binding. However, AMS has an
 * additional `ConnectionRecord` concept, where for a given `ServiceConnection`, each
 * `Context.bindService()` call creates is a new `ConnectionRecord`. This means that repeatedly
 * re-binding with a given `ServiceConnection` will cause `ConnectionRecord` objects to accumulate
 * in AMS, and there is a hard limit how many `ConnectionRecord`s a process can have. Unfortunately,
 * the only way to free `ConnectionRecord` objects is to unbind the entire connection. This means
 * it's necessary to use a dedicated `ServiceConnection` to trigger re-binding for
 * `Context.updateServiceGroup()`, as the unbindings necessary to free `ConnectionRecord`s would
 * interfere with the lifecycle management of a normal binding.
 *
 * <p>* Accumulation of un-GC'ed Binder proxies
 *
 * <p>`LoadedApk$ServiceDispatcher$InnerConnection` is created per new `Context` and
 * `ServiceConnection` combination on `Context.bindService()` in the Android SDK. The inner
 * connection represents a binder proxy and is GC-ed when GC happened on AMS. Though Binder Proxy is
 * GC-ed eventually, if there are too many calls of pairs of `Context.bindService()` and
 * `Context.unbindService()` in a short term even with the same `ServiceConnection`, Chrome can be
 * killed due to too many Binder Proxy remaining.
 *
 * <p>To prevent the first issue, `ChildProcessConnection` uses this short living service connection
 * `RebindServiceConnection` and `RebindServiceConnection.rebind()` unbinds itself just after
 * binding it if maxDeferredConnections is zero.
 *
 * <p>If the second issue is problematic, RebindServiceConnection supports deferring unbinding so
 * that it can be reused for multiple processes without increasing the Binder Proxy by setting
 * maxDeferredConnections as non-zero. The `ConnectionRecord`s in AMS are cleared when the number of
 * deferred connections reaches to maxDeferredConnections.
 *
 * <p>When `ChildProcessConnection` wants to kill the process (e.g. `unbind()`), keeping the
 * deferred connections prevents the process from being freed by AMS. `ChildProcessConnection` have
 * to call `RebindServiceConnection.unbind()` to clear all deferred connections when
 * `ChildProcessConnection` unbinds the waived binding to avoid the leak.
