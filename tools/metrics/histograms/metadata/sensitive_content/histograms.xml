  <summary>
    Records the latency between the moment when a sensitive form appears in the
    DOM (or from the moment the form becomes sensitive, if initially not
    sensitive) and the moment when the content is marked as sensitive, in
    {Embedder}. This metric is emitted only when the content sensitivity changes
    from not sensitive to sensitive.

  <summary>
    Records for how long the content was marked as sensitive, in {Embedder}.
    That is, it measures the time elapsed between when the content was last
    marked as sensitive until the content was last marked as not sensitive. This
    metric is emitted every time the content sensitivity of a WebContents
    changes from sensitive to not sensitive.

  <summary>
    Emitted when the content changed its sensitivity from sensitive to not
    sensitive and vice-versa, in {Embedder}. On page load, the content is
    considered not sensitive. This metric gets recorded every time the content
    sensitivity of a WebContents changes.
