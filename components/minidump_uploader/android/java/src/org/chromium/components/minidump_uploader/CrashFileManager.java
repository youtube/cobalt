/**
 * The CrashFileManager is responsible for managing the "Crash Reports" directory containing
 * minidump files and shepherding them through a state machine represented by the file names.
 *  1. Minidumps are read from Crashpad's CrashReportDatabase and re-written as MIME files in the
 *     "Crash Reports" directory as foo.dmpNNNNN where NNNNN is the PID (process id) of the
 *     crashing process.
 *  2. foo.dmpNNNNN.try0 is a minidump file with recent logcat output attached to it; or a file for
 *     which logcat output has been intentionally omitted. Notably, Webview-generated minidumps do
 *     not include logcat output.
 *  3. foo.dmpNNNNN.tryM for M > 0 is a minidump file that's been attempted to be uploaded to the
 *     crash server, but for which M upload attempts have failed.
 *  4. foo.upNNNNN.tryM names a successfully uploaded file.
 *  5. foo.skippedNNNNN.tryM names for a file whose upload was skipped. An upload may be skipped,
 *     for example, if the user has not consented to uploading crash reports. These files are marked
 *     as skipped rather than deleted immediately to allow the user to manually initiate an upload.
 *  6. foo.forcedNNNNN.tryM names a file that the user has manually requested to upload.
 *  7. foo.tmp is a temporary file.
