# Updating policy_templates.json can have drastic effects for systems depending
# on policy definitions (for example, Google's cloud management tools for
# Chrome and Chrome OS). Thus, special attention to forward/backward
# compatibility issues is required and review is restricted to the list of
# people below.
# The rules are documented at:
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/enterprise/add_new_policy.md

# Prefer enterprise-policy-review@ to individual owners. Sending code
# reviews to the alias allows the owners to distribute code review loads.
