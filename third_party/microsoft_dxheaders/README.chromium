Description:
DirectX-Headers hosts the official Direct3D 12 and DirectML headers. These
headers are made available under the MIT license rather than the traditional
Windows SDK license.

Chromium code uses these header files to use DirectX features that ship before
official Windows releases. Testing is performed with either the Direct3D
Agility SDK or the version of DirectML available through the NuGet package.

Local Modifications: None
