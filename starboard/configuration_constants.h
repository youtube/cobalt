// The current platform's file path component separator character. This is the

// component separator character.

// as many keys.

// it.

// auto-tuning is better.

// dramatically affect throughput in the presence of latency.

// specifying an ordered list of absolute paths of directories to search for a
// given reason, this is the character that appears between entries. For
// example, the search path of "/etc/search/first:/etc/search/second" uses ':'
// as a search path component separator character.
