# Android WebView Community Guidelines

## Purpose of the android-webview-dev mailing list

[android-webview-dev] is a public mailing list for Android WebView technical
development. This is intended to be a way to foster open source collaboration
and have discussions about technical changes to the Android WebView open source
code.

This mailing list is not intended to be a way of reporting bugs, making feature
requests, etc. Those topics are better raised on
https://issues.chromium.org/issues/new?component=1456456&template=1923373,
https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=460423, or another public
forum.

## Code of conduct

The [android-webview-dev] mailing list is part of the chromium project and thus
it follows the chromium code of conduct. Please familiarize yourself with the
[code of conduct]. All discussions on this list must follow this policy.

## Moderation

Simply put, community discussions should be:

* Respectful and kind;
* About Android WebView or Chromium;
* About features and code, not the individuals involved.

At our discretion, we will moderate posts which are spam, offensive, or violate
the code of conduct. This may include (but is not limited to):

* Unsolicited advertisements
* Newsletters
* Offers for products or services
* Rude or offensive language

The goal of moderation is to cut down on spam and ensure discussions follow the
code of conduct. This mailing list is an important feedback channel and we do
not want moderation to silence legitimate feedback. In particular, we aim to
allow posts which are:

* Any post which is on-topic for this mailing list.
* One-time mistakes. Ex. if someone contacts the mailing list with complaints
  about a software defect, we may (at our discretion) allow the post but inform
  the poster that the bug tracker is a more appropriate forum for such a topic.
* Feedback or criticism of WebView functionality. We value both positive and
  critical feedback from the community about WebView functionality, however
  please remember that this feedback must be respectful and should be on the
  topic of features and code.
