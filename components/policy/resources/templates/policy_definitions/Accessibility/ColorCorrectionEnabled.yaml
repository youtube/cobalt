  Enable the color correction accessibility feature.

            This feature enables users to adjust the color correction settings on their managed <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> devices, which may make it easier for users with color vision deficiency to perceive colors on their screen.

            If this policy is set to enabled, color correction will always be enabled; users will need to go into Settings to pick their specific color correction options (e.g. Deuteranomaly/Protanomaly/Tritanamaly/Greyscale filter and intensity). Color correction settings are displayed to the user on first use.

            If this policy is set to disabled, color correction will always be disabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, the color correction feature is disabled initially but can be enabled by the user anytime.
