Description:
This is a free and open source implementation of ASN.1 types and codecs as a Python package. It has been first written to support particular protocol (SNMP) but then generalized to be suitable for a wide range of protocols based on ASN.1 specification.

This was installed as a dependency of google-auth via pip.
