caption: Configure the required domain names for remote access clients
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies the client domain names that are imposed on remote access clients, and users can't change them. Only clients from one of the specified domains can connect to the host.

        Setting the policy to an empty list or leaving it unset applies the default policy for the connection type. For remote assistance, this allows clients from any domain to connect to the host. For anytime remote access, only the host owner can connect.

        See also <ph name="REMOTE_ACCESS_HOST_DOMAIN_LIST_POLICY_NAME">RemoteAccessHostDomainList</ph>.

        Note: This setting overrides <ph name="REMOTE_ACCESS_HOST_CLIENT_DOMAIN_POLICY_NAME">RemoteAccessHostClientDomain</ph>, if present.
