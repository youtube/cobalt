    Counts of how many times onPostCreate() and onResume() were called (from the
    ChromeActivity class) when a foreground session begins in the native C++
    code. The counters are reset when this histogram is emitted. This histogram
    is a diagnostic tool for understanding Clank short sessions, by capturing
    some information about the cases where Java code starts up, but native C++
    code is never reached.

    This replaces UMA.AndroidPreNative.ChromeActivityCounter, which would
    increment the counters to P1R0 on first-run-experience, but would not
    advance to native code. This version circumvents the issue by waiting to be
    sure that onCreate was not aborted (see AsyncInitializationActivity).

  <owner>lucnguyen@google.com</owner>
  <owner>src/base/metrics/OWNERS</owner>
  <summary>
    The current status of a ping sent by the browser process to a child process.
    Emitted in 3 steps: 1. When the browser process sends a ping IPC to the
    child process (BROWSER_SENT_IPC), 2. When the child process receives said
    IPC (CHILD_RECEIVED_IPC), and 3. When the browser process receives a reply
    from the child process after the IPC was processed (BROWSER_REPLY_CALLBACK).

    Because a child process may exit early and never receive the IPC (even in
    normal scenarios), 1 may not match 2 and 3 in total count. However, 2 and 3
    should be equivalent, and that them not matching should be an indication of
    loss of child process histograms. Note that 1 and 3 are emitted from the
    browser process, while 2 is emitted from the child process.

    {Source}

    Caveat: Because this histogram is emitted from the child process after the
    shared memory is set up, the histogram will live on it (except if there were
    failures in creating it), so this histogram quantifies lost histograms from
    the shared memory. In particular, histograms that are emitted very early on
    in a child process do not live on the shared memory, and are passed to the
    browser process through IPCs. This histogram, mostly, does not quantify the
    loss of those histograms.

  <summary>
    An enum representing the sign-in status of all regular profiles with open
    browser windows at the time a UMA log record is closed (i.e., excluding
    system and guest profiles). Recorded once in every ongoing metrics log; not
    recorded in logs about the previous session. System, Guest and Incognito
    profiles are ignored because the user cannot sign-in into them.

    Being signed into the browser means, for example, the user sees their Google
    account on the New Tab Page and in the toolbar at the top of the browser.

    A signed in user may have a currently invalid token; they are in
    authentication error state and need to refresh their credentials. As a
    concrete example, it means the user may not get personalized results and
    suggestions when using google.com.

    On desktop, when Chrome is running and there are no profiles with open
    browser windows (this can happen on Mac), this histogram will report
    &quot;Unknown sign-in status&quot;.

    On Android, when Chrome is running and there are no profiles with open
    browser windows (this can happen when Chrome is doing something in the
    background), it will report the sign-in status as if there were an open
    browser window.

    If a profile is open during the time period covered by this log record but
    closed before the log record is closed, the profile's status will not be
    reflected in this histogram.

  <summary>
    An enum representing the sync status of all regular profiles with open
    browser windows at the time a UMA log record is closed (i.e., excluding
    system and guest profiles). Recorded once in every ongoing metrics log; not
    recorded in logs about the previous session. System, Guest and Incognito
    profiles are ignored because the user cannot sign-in into them.

    If a profile is open during the time period covered by this log record but
    closed before the log record is closed, the profile's status will not be
    reflected in this histogram.

    Sync status indicates the profile has consented to sync and has a valid
    credential for the account (i.e., is signed-in), meaning sync in principle
    should be working. For example, if the user signs out of the web, their
    credentials will be put into an error state; they will not be valid. The
    profile will not be considered to be syncing. It is possible that the user
    is technically syncing (according to this histogram and Chrome) yet not
    syncing at that instant. Examples of this include (i) user is offline and
    (ii) user disabled syncing for all sync data types but didn't revoke
    consent.

    Sample rate applied to this client, expressed as number of clients per 1000
    that are in the sample. Recorded on every log upload but only if the client
    is eligible for sampling. (As of February 2021, all clients on Android and
    Windows are eligible for sampling. Prior to Jan 26 2021, only Windows and
    Android installs on which the UMA checkbox was enabled by default were
    eligible, see b/161848997).

    Clients not eligible for sampling will not have this histogram recorded.

    Clients that are eligible for sampling but are sampled out (i.e., not
    uploading logs) will not have this histogram recorded. Notably, it will not
    appear in chrome://histograms! (Obviously, it also won't appear in the UMA
    logs because the client is not uploading logs.)

    Additional nuance, hopefully not important: the rate refers to the session
    that the log was generated in, not the session the log was generated about.
    This means when UMA uploads information about the last session (such as
    stability statistics), it is possible--though extremely unlikely--that the
    sampling rate config has changed from the previous session to the current
    one. As such, the sampling rate emitted in a previous-session log record may
    not be the right one that should've applied to that record.
