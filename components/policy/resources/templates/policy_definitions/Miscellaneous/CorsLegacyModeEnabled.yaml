  Use the legacy <ph name="CORS">CORS</ph> implementation rather than new <ph name="CORS">CORS</ph>.

        If this setting is set to True, the legacy implementation is used that should be compatible with previous versions.

        If this setting is set to False, or is not set, the new implementation is used that might cause enterprise specific compatibility issues potentially.

        This policy will be removed after a couple of milestones.

        Note that this policy was announced to be removed in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 82, but removed in version 84.
