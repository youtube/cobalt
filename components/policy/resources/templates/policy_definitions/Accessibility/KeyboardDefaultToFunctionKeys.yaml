caption: Media keys default to function keys
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to True makes the top row of keys on the keyboard act as function key commands. Pressing the Search key changes their behavior back to media keys.

        If set to False or not set, the keyboard defaults to producing media key commands. Pressing the Search key changes them to function keys.
