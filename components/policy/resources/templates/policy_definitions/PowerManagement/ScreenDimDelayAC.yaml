caption: Screen dim delay when running on AC power
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Note that this policy is deprecated and will be removed in <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> version 85. Please use <ph name="POWER_MANAGEMENT_IDLE_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">PowerManagementIdleSettings</ph> instead.

            Specifies the length of time without user input after which the screen is dimmed when running on AC power.

            When this policy is set to a value greater than zero, it specifies the length of time that the user must remain idle before <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> dims the screen.

            When this policy is set to zero, <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> does not dim the screen when the user becomes idle.

            When this policy is unset, a default length of time is used.

            The policy value should be specified in milliseconds. Values are clamped to be less than or equal the screen off delay (if set) and the idle delay.
