# layout-test-tidy

This tool, a Node.js CLI utility, performs a set of clean-up tasks for layout
test files in web_tests/webaudio. (Potentially it can be applied to any kind
of layout test files in HTML or JS format.)

The clean-up tasks includes:

  - Sanitize missing or incorrect HTML elements: reordering |script| elements
    or adding missing |title| element.
  - Apply [html-tidy](http://www.html-tidy.org/).
  - Apply [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).
  - Perform RegExp substitution based on predefined dictionary. (e.g. |var| to
    |let|, or redundant empty lines in markup.)

For every step of clean-up processing, the tool collects warning, diagnostics
or notes and print out the logs at the end of the processing.


## Installation

The `run_web_tests.py` script process all the files in the `webaudio/` directory, so files created by the node package installation will pollute the test result. To avoid this, copy `tools/` directory to another directory. Then run the following in that directory.

```
cd ${WHERE_PACKAGE_JSON_IS} npm install
```

The warning from html-tidy package can be safely ignored.


## Usage

```
node layout-test-tidy [-[viR]] ${TARGET_PATH}
```

Available options:
 * `-v` or `--verbose`: verbose output. Useful when collecting warnings and notes generated by the tool.
 * `-i` or `--inplace`: in-place processing. Write directly into the original file.
 * `-R` or `--recursive`: Expand the given path recursively.

The result will be written to stdout, and only HTML and JS files with proper file extension (.html, .js) will be processed.

### Examples

```
# To collect the result with warning/notes to a file.
node layout-test-tidy -v ${TARGET_PATH} > result.txt

# Apply in-place tidy to the entire layout test files for WebAudio.
node layout-test-tidy -i -R ${CHROME_SRC}/third_party/blink/web_tests/webaudio
```
