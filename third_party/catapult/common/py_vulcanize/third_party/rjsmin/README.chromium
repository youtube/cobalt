Description:
rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in python.
The minifier is based on the semantics of jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford.
The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at runtime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the same results as the original jsmin.c.

Modifications made:
 - Removed the bench.sh since the file doesn't have the licensing info and
   caused license checker to fail.
 - Added a small hack to not clobber template strings. (Not a complete solution
   since it won't handle nesting. E.g. `${'`'} foo` would probably cause
   problems).
