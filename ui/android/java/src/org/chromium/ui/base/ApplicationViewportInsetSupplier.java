/**
 * A class responsible for managing multiple users of UI insets over the application viewport.
 *
 * UI insets are complicated. The application viewport is provided by CompositorViewHolder but the
 * browser provides various UI controls which overlay the viewport. How these UI controls interact
 * with the underlying WebContents varies between controls and can depend on web-APIs.
 *
 * For example, browser controls cause the WebContents to resize so that the web page reflows in
 * response to showing/hiding (although the timing of when this happens is non-straightforward). On
 * the other hand, the virtual keyboard should resize only the page's visualViewport, without
 * affecting layout. Chrome provides "keyboard accessories" that appear to the user to be part of
 * the keyboard but are actually separate UI components. To make matters even more complicated, the
 * page can change how the virtual keyboard affects the page (to affect page layout).
 *
 * This class aims to centralize and encapsulate all these complex interactions so clients don't
 * have to worry about the details. This class currently handles only the keyboard and keyboard
 * accessory but there are plans to move browser controls into here as well
 * (https://crbug.com/1211066).
 *
 * Features needing to know if anything is obscuring part of the screen listen to this class via
 * {@link #addObserver(Callback)} which observes changes to a {@link ViewportInsets} object which
 * has various inset types clients can use. See that class for more detials about the inset types.
 *
 * In general:
 *  - Features that want to modify the inset should pass around the {@link
 *    ApplicationViewportInsetSupplier} object.
 *  - Features only interested in what the current inset is should pass around an {@link
 *    ObservableSupplier<ViewportInsets>} object.
