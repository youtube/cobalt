caption: Allow access to a list of URLs
desc: |-
  Setting the policy provides access to the listed URLs, as exceptions to <ph name="URL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">URLBlocklist</ph>. See that policy's description for the format of entries of this list. For example, setting <ph name="URL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">URLBlocklist</ph> to * will block all requests, and you can use this policy to allow access to a limited list of URLs. Use it to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths, using the format specified at ( https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format ). The most specific filter determines if a URL is blocked or allowed. The <ph name="URL_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">URLAllowlist</ph> policy takes precedence over <ph name="URL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">URLBlocklist</ph>. This policy is limited to 1,000 entries.

        This policy also allows enabling the automatic invocation by the browser of external application registered as protocol handlers for the listed protocols like "tel:" or "ssh:".

        Leaving the policy unset allows no exceptions to <ph name="URL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">URLBlocklist</ph>.

        From <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 92, this policy is also supported in the headless mode.

        On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft速 Windows速</ph>, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft速 Active Directory速</ph> domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>. On <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph>, this functionality is only available on instances that are managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.
