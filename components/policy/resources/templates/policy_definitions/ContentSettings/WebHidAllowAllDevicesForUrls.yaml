caption: Automatically grant permission to sites to connect to any HID device.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy allows you to list sites which are automatically granted permission to access all available devices.

        The URLs must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored. Only the origin (scheme, host and port) of the URL is considered.

        On ChromeOS, this policy only applies to affiliated users.

        This policy overrides <ph name="DEFAULT_WEB_HID_GUARD_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultWebHidGuardSetting</ph>, <ph name="WEB_HID_ASK_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">WebHidAskForUrls</ph>, <ph name="WEB_HID_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">WebHidBlockedForUrls</ph> and the user's preferences.
