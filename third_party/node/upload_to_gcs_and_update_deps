# Upload content to GCS and set DEPS
# 1) The Python script uploads content to Google Cloud Storage and returns a
#    string that part of it contains the JSON which need be used to
#    update the DEPS file. Here is a sample response.
#Uploading node_modules.tar.gz as gs://chromium-nodejs/<sha1>
#{
#  "path": {
#    "dep_type": "gcs",
#    "bucket": "chromium-nodejs",
#    "objects": [
#      {
#        "object_name":
#          "97a0b3c4c39cf05de1eafb6ffdec0fddd643f0a2",
#        "sha256sum":
#          "dcfaea4d353d1df3d4ac2d245ea7e32ad177d4bea1351f363714c9c22ca5c4f8",
#        "size_bytes": 9761601,
#        "generation": 1716489161461140
#      }
#    ]
#  }
#}
# 2) grep gets only the JSON part in the string.
# 3) jq extracts the `objects` in the returned JSON.
# 4) sed generates the output by replacing newlines with commas and
#    removing any trailing commas.
# 5) The output will be like
#    `{object_name},{sha256sum},{size_bytes},{generation}`
# These values will be used to update the DEPS file using `gclient setdep`.
