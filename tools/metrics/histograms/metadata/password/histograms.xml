  <summary>
    The amount of active browsing time that was spent in different user states
    related to the PasswordManager's account-scoped storage.

    This time is measured from when the user starts interacting with the browser
    until either they stopped interacting with the browser (as determined by
    DesktopSessionDurationTracker) or their user state changes. These end-points
    are when the metric is emitted.

    Because a duration can end either because the user became inactive or
    because their status changed, the distribution of individual durations
    measured are unlikely to be helpful. Instead, please compare total
    durations.

    This metric is only recorded on Win/Mac/Linux/iOS/Android (iOS from M113,
    Android from M128).

    Note: As part of crbug/1223007, we discovered that histogram
    PasswordManager.AccountStorageUserStateDuration.SignedOutUser was recorded
    for Guest and System profiles which wasn't intentional. This was fixed in
    M93.

    One caveat with this metric is that if the user has multiple profiles open
    at the same time, their session activity will be logged from all the
    profiles, instead of only from the profile that the user is using at that
    moment.

    This metric records the user experience with regards to passwords filling.

    (automatic filling on page load without user interaction necessary) to the
    worst (the user had to manually type a password that was already saved).

    The following buckets (4..5) indicate cases when it was impossible to fill
    credentials because unknown credentials were submitted, meaning that the
    submitted password was not saved before.

    The last bucket (6) corresponds to the strange cases, where the submitted
    form has neither user input nor autofilled data in password fields. This
    might indicate third-party password manager use, or might be a
    measurement/submission classification error.
