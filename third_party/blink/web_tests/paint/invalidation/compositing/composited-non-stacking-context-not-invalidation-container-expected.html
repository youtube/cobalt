    This test succeed if the text gets repainted with a green background.<br/>
    The text belongs to a (pseudo) stacking context that is enclosed by a composited
    non-stacking context. Since the parent is not a stacking context, this (pseudo)
    stacking context should be painted as a child stacking context of the root.
