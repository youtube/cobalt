caption: Allow DNS queries for additional DNS record types
default: true
desc: |-
  This policy controls whether <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> may query additional DNS record types when making insecure DNS requests. This policy has no effect on DNS queries made via Secure DNS, which may always query additional DNS types.

        If this policy is unset or set to Enabled, additional types such as <ph name="DNS_TYPE_HTTPS">HTTPS</ph> (DNS type 65) may be queried in addition to <ph name="DNS_TYPE_A">A</ph> (DNS type 1) and <ph name="DNS_TYPE_AAAA">AAAA</ph> (DNS type 28).

        If this policy is set to Disabled, DNS will only be queried for <ph name="DNS_TYPE_A">A</ph> (DNS type 1) and/or <ph name="DNS_TYPE_AAAA">AAAA</ph> (DNS type 28).

        This policy is a temporary measure and will be removed in future versions of <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>. After removal of the policy, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will always be able to query additional DNS types.
