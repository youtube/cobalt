This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] e.style['hyphenate-limit-chars'] = "auto auto" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "auto" but got "auto auto"
[FAIL] e.style['hyphenate-limit-chars'] = "auto auto auto" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "auto" but got "auto auto auto"
[FAIL] e.style['hyphenate-limit-chars'] = "5 2 2" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "5 2" but got "5 2 2"
[FAIL] e.style['hyphenate-limit-chars'] = "auto 2 2" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "auto 2" but got "auto 2 2"
