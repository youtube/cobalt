This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] controller.error() should close writable immediately after readable.cancel()
  promise_rejects_exactly: closed should reject with thrownError function "function() { throw e }" threw object "ignoredError: ignoredError" but we expected it to throw object "error1: bad things are happening!"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
