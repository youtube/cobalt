caption: Block third-party storage partitioning for these origins
desc: |-
  Allows you to set a list of url patterns that specify top-level (the url in the tab's address bar) origins which block third-party storage partitioning (partitioning of cross-origin iframe storage).
            If this policy is left not set or a top-level origin doesn't match then the value from <ph name="DEFAULT_THIRD_PARTY_STORAGE_PARTITIONING_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultThirdPartyStoragePartitioningSetting</ph> will be used.
            For detailed information on valid patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.
            Note that patterns you list here are treated as origins, not URLs, so you should not specify a path.
            For detailed information on third-party storage partitioning, please see https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/storage-partitioning/.
