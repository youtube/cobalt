"""clang-format 3-way merge driver.

This is a custom merge driver for git that helps automatically resolves
conflicts caused by clang-format changes. The conflict resolution
strategy is extremely simple: it simply clang-formats the current,
ancestor branch's, and other branch's version of the file and delegates
the remaining work to git merge-file.

See https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes ("Defining a custom merge
driver") for more details.
