caption: Default third-party storage partitioning setting
default: 1
desc: |-
  This policy controls whether third-party storage partitioning is allowed by default.

  If this policy is set to 1 - AllowPartitioning, or unset, third-party storage partitioning will be allowed by default. This default may be overridden for specific top-level origins by other means.

  If this policy is set to 2 - BlockPartitioning, third-party storage partitioning will be disabled for all contexts.

  Use <ph name="THIRD_PARTY_STORAGE_PARTITIONING_BLOCKED_FOR_ORIGINS_POLICY_NAME">ThirdPartyStoragePartitioningBlockedForOrigins</ph> to disable third-party storage partitioning for specific top-level origins. For detailed information on third-party storage partitioning, please see https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/cookies/storage-partitioning.
