Description:
Python tool to generate C++ wrappers for (mostly Android-related) JNI/Java
objects. Generated files are typically slightly hand-modified.

Local Modifications:
No modifications to upstream files. BUILD.gn contains all of the configurations
needed to build the library in Chromium, along with its dependencies. Since it
is a transitive dependency that was directly included in OpenXR SDK repository,
the exact revision is unknown. The library also does not have any versioned
releases. The library contains auto-generated files with unknown hand-made
modifications. The library is triple-licensed, and the copy from OpenXR SDK
repository does not include a LICENSE file.
