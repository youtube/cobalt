This directory contains code for scheduling metrics which are shared between
renderer process and browser process.

These metrics include:
- Expected queueing time (EQT) calculation.
- Per-thread task duration metrics.

This component should not have any dependencies other than //base as it 
should be able to be used from any other place.
