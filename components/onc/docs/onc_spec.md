# Open Network Configuration

[TOC]

## Objective

We would like to create a simple, open, but complete format to describe
multiple network configurations for WiFi, Ethernet, Cellular,
Bluetooth/WiFi-Direct, and VPN connections in a single file format, in order
to simplify and automate network configuration for users.

## Background

Configuring networks is a painful and error-prone experience for users. It
is a problem shared across desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone users of all
operating system types. It is exacerbated in business and schools which
often have complex network configurations (VPNs and 802.1X networking) that
change often and have many connected devices. Configuration of WiFi is
still done manually, often by administrators physically standing next to
users working on devices. Certificate distribution is particularly painful
which often results in admins instead using passphrases to protect networks
or using protocols without client certificates that instead use LDAP
passwords for authentication. Even after networks are configured, updates to
the network configuration require another round of manual changes, and
accidental changes by a user or malicious changes by an attacker can break
connectivity or make connections less private or secure.

## Overview

We propose a single-file format for network configuration that is
human-readable, can describe all of the common kinds of network
configurations, supports integrity checking, certificate and key
provisioning, and updating. The file can be encrypted with a single
passphrase so that upon entering the passphrase the entire configuration is
loaded. The format can be described as an open format to enable multiple OS
vendors to interoperate and share configuration editors.

This format neither supports configuring browser settings nor allows setting
other types of system policies.

## Infrastructure

A standalone configuration editor will be created, downloadable as a Chrome
app. This editor will allow creating, modifying, and encrypting an open
network configuration file in a way that is intuitive for a system
administrator.

This file format may be delivered to a user and manually imported into a
device.

This file format may be created by an administrator, stored in a policy
repository, and automatically pushed to a device.

## Detailed Design

We use JSON format for the files. The fields in a JSON file are always
case-sensitive, so the exact case of the fields in this section must be
matched. In addition, the values that are called out as explicit constants
must also match the case specified (e.g. WiFi must not be written as wifi,
etc.). This document describes a minimum set of required fields and optional
fields. Other fields may be created, however, see the
implementation-specific fields for guidelines for these fields.

The JSON consists of a top level dictionary containing
a `Type` field which must have either the value
[EncryptedConfiguration](#EncryptedConfiguration-type) or
[UnencryptedConfiguration](#UnencryptedConfiguration-type).

For a description of the [EncryptedConfiguration](#EncryptedConfiguration-type)
type, see the section on [Encrypted Configuration](#Encrypted-Configuration)
below.
The [EncryptedConfiguration](#Encrypted-Configuration) format encrypts
an unencrypted JSON object.

## GUIDs and Updating

This format allows for importing updated network configurations and
certificates by providing GUIDs to each network configuration and
certificate so they can be modified or even removed in future updates.

GUIDs are non-empty strings that are meant to be stable and unique. When
they refer to the same entity, they should be the same between ONC files. No
two different networks or certificates should have the same GUID, similarly
a network and certificate should not have the same GUID. A single ONC file
should not contain the same entity twice (with the same GUID). Failing any
of these tests indicates the ONC file is not valid.

Any GUID referred to in an ONC file must be present in the same ONC file. In
particular, it is an error to create a certificate in one ONC file and refer
to it in a NetworkConfiguration in another ONC file and not define it there,
even if the previous ONC file has been imported.

## Implementation-specific fields

As there are many different kinds of connections and some that are not yet
anticipated may require new fields. This format allows arbitrary other
fields to be added.

Fields and values should follow these general guidelines:

* Certificates (with and without keys) should always be placed in the
  certificate section - specifically certificate contents should not be
  placed in fields directly. Referring to certificates should be done using
  a field whose name ends in Ref and whose value is the GUID of the
  certificate, or if the certificate is not contained in this file, its
  pattern can be described using a field ending in Pattern of
  [CertificatePattern](#CertificatePattern-type) type.
* Fields should exist in the most-specific object in the hierarchy and
  should be named CamelCase style.
* Booleans and integers should be used directly instead of using a
  stringified version of the type.

Any editor of network configuration information should allows the user to
modify any fields that are implementation-specific. It may not be present
directly in the UI but it should be able to import files with such settings
and leave preserve these settings on export.

## Unencrypted Configuration

When the top level **Type** field
is *UnencryptedConfiguration*, the top level JSON
has the [UnencryptedConfiguration](#UnencryptedConfiguration-type) type.

### UnencryptedConfiguration type

* **Type**
    * (optional, defaults to *UnencryptedConfiguration*) - **string**
    * Must be *UnencryptedConfiguration*.

* **NetworkConfigurations**
    * (optional) - [array of NetworkConfiguration](#Network-Configuration)
    * Describes WiFi, Ethernet, VPN, and wireless connections.

* **Certificates**
    * (optional) - [array of Certificate](#Certificate-type)
    * Contains certificates stored in X.509 or PKCS#12 format.

---
  * At least one actual configuration field
    (**NetworkConfigurations** or **Certificates**) should be present,
    however it should not be considered an error if no such field is present.
---

## Global Network Configuration

Field **GlobaNetworkConfiguration** has the [GlobalNetworkConfiguration]
(#GlobalNetworkConfiguration-type) type.

### GlobalNetworkConfiguration type

The [GlobalNetworkConfiguration](#GlobalNetworkConfiguration-type) contains
settings which apply to all of the networks that the device may connect to. The
client supports this only in device-level policy; the client-side ONC validator
fails if it appears in user policy.
To avoid bricking devices, these policies will only be enforced in user
sessions. The login screen ignores these policies and may still be used for
fetching new policy or logging in.
A [Help Center article](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6326250)
warns admins of the implications of mis-using this policy for Chrome OS.

* **AllowCellularHotspot**
    * (optional, defaults to true) - **boolean**
    * When this field is present and set to true, chromebook users will be allowed to
      turn on hotspot on their devices. If there is an active hotspot and this field
      is set to false, hotspot will be turned off and a notification will be
      displayed to the user.

* **AllowCellularSimLock**
    * (optional, defaults to true) - **boolean**
    * When this field is present and set to false, a SIM cannot be PIM Locked on
      a managed device. If the currently active SIM is already PIN Locked when
      this field turns false, the managed user will be guided to PIN unlock the
      SIM.

* **AllowOnlyPolicyCellularNetworks**
    * (optional, defaults to false) - **boolean**
    * When this field is present and set to true, only cellular networks present
      in policy may be connected to. No new cellular networks may be added or
      configured. This allows admins to ensure that only policy configured
      cellular networks are accessible.

* **AllowOnlyPolicyNetworksToAutoconnect**
    * (optional, defaults to false) - **boolean**
    * When this field is present and set to true, on startup the device will
      only auto connect to those networks that are present in its policy. This
      is necessary for devices that are used as kiosks, for example, so that
      they can’t be hijacked by some other user on startup.

* **AllowOnlyPolicyNetworksToConnect**
    * (optional, defaults to false) - **boolean**
    * When this field is present and set to true, only networks present in
      policy may be connected to. This allows schools to enforce that only
      known-good networks (e.g., filtered student networks) may be used.
      Existing connections to unmanaged networks will be disconnected on policy
      fetch.

* **AllowOnlyPolicyNetworksToConnectIfAvailable**
    * (optional, defaults to false) - **boolean**
    * When this field is present, set to true and a policy network is in range,
      only policy networks may be connected to. If no managed network is in
      range (e.g. user’s home), the device may connect to any network. If
      enabled and a network scan shows a new policy managed network, the device
      will automatically switch to the managed network.

* **AllowAPNModification**
    * (optional, defaults to true) - **boolean**
    * Only relevant when the admin does not specify APNs for a SIM. Note that
      users cannot modify any admin assigned APNs. When this field is present
      and set to false, users won't have the capabilities to add, modify, and
      use their own custom APNs for cellular networks that do not have an APN
      specified by the admin. When this field is unset or set to true, users
      will have the aforementioned capabilities for an eSIM with no
      AdminAssignedAPNIds, and for any pSIM if there are no PSIMAssignedAPNIds.

* **AllowTextMessages**
    * (optional, defaults to Unset) - **string**
    * When this field is present and set to Allow text message notifications
     will be shown. When this field is set to Suppress, no text message
     notifications will be shown and text messages will be dropped forever.
     When this field is Unset, text messages notifications will be shown by
     default and will allow user configuration for suppressing text messages.
     * Allowed values are:
        * *Allow*
        * *Suppress*
        * *Unset*

* **BlacklistedHexSSIDs** <!--- nocheck -->
    * DEPRECATED, use **BlockedHexSSIDs** instead.<br/>
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * List of strings containing blocked hex SSIDs. Networks included in
      this list will not be connectable. Existing connections to networks
      contained in this list will be disconnected on policy fetch.

* **BlockedHexSSIDs**
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * List of strings containing blocked hex SSIDs. Networks included in
      this list will not be connectable. Existing connections to networks
      contained in this list will be disconnected on policy fetch.

* **DisableNetworkTypes**
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * Allowed values are:
        * *Cellular*
        * *Ethernet*
        * *WiFi*
        * *Tether*
        * *VPN*
    * List of strings containing disabled network interfaces.
    * Adding *VPN* to the list will disable all VPN types. Android VPN
      connections may still be established successfully but will be
      closed shortly after that by the Chrome OS connection manager.

* **PSIMAdminAssignedAPNs**
    * (optional) - [array of APN](#APN-type)
    * Setting this field directly will have no effect, as it will be
      automatically constructed from the provided *PSIMAdminAssignedAPNIds*,
      each mapping to a unique APN in the the top-level *AdminAPNList*.
      For all pSIMs, *CustomAPNList* will set to *PSIMAdminAssignedAPNs*.

* **PSIMAdminAssignedAPNIds**
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * List of custom APN configuration IDs added by the admin that map to APNs
      that will be applied to all available pSIMs. *PSIMAdminAssignedAPNs* will
      be automatically constructed from the provided *PSIMAdminAssignedAPNIds*,
      each mapping to a unique APN in the the top-level *AdminAPNList*.

* **RecommendedValuesAreEphemeral**
    * (optional, defaults to false) - **boolean**
    * When this field is set to true, settings of device-wide policy-provided
      network configurations marked as "Recommended" will be regarded as
      ephemeral. These settings will be reverted to the policy-recommended (or
      default) value on reboot (startup), logout, and when the device has been
      idle.

* **UserCreatedNetworkConfigurationsAreEphemeral**
    * (optional, defaults to false) - **boolean**
    * When this field is set to true, device-wide network configurations created
      by the user will be regarded as ephemeral.  These network configurations
      will be deleted on reboot (startup), logout, and when the device has been
      idle.

    * (optional) - **string**
    * Allowed values are:
        * *None*
        * *8021X*

## IPConfig

Objects of type [IPConfig](#IPConfig-type) are used to report the
actual IP configuration of a connected network (see
**IPConfigs**), the IP configuration received from
DHCP (see **SavedIPConfig**) and to configure a
static IP configuration (see **StaticIPConfig**).

### IPConfig type

      whose traffic should be handled by the network. Example:
      `["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.5.0/24"]`. These routes will supplement the
      existing routes for this network; physical networks (**Type** *Cellular*,
      *Ethernet*, or *WiFi*) and *L2TP-IPsec* VPN networks will by default route
      all traffic sent to them. *ARCVPN* and *ThirdPartyVPN* VPN networks have

          shouldn't associate with any AP. `"00:00:00:00:00:00"` shouldn't be a
          part of any other list of values, otherwise it may cause an error.

* **BSSIDRequested**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * BSSID that the AP should connect to. BSSIDs
      should be formatted as colon-separated octets (e.g.
      `"00:01:02:03:04:05"`).
    * If the AP cannot connect to the requested BSSID, then it will not fallback
      to another BSSID and will remain unconnected.
    * If **BSSIDRequested** is empty and **BSSIDAllowlist** is not, then the
      WiFi network will follow the values in **BSSIDAllowlist**
    * If **BSSIDAllowlist** is empty and **BSSIDRequested** is not, then the
      WiFi network will follow the value in **BSSIDRequested**
    * If **BSSIDRequested** and **BSSIDAllowlist** have a disjoint set of
      values, then the WiFi network will not connect.
    * If **BSSIDRequested** is also in **BSSIDAllowlist**, then the network will
      follow the value in **BSSIDRequested**

* **EAP**
    * (required if [**Security**](#wifi-security) is: *WEP-8021X*, *WPA-EAP* or
      any value with *-Enterprise* suffix; otherwise ignored)

      - **string**
    * Describes the passphrase for WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3
      connections. If *WEP-PSK* is used, the passphrase
      must be of the format 0x&lt;hex-number&gt;, where &lt;hex-number&gt; is
      40, 104, 128, or 232 bits.

    * (required) - **string**
    * Type of security that should be used for the WiFi network:
        * *None*: Class of networks where no preconfigured security data is
          needed (e.g. *Passphrase*).  This includes both open networks and
          networks using OWE to configure encryption (either pure or
          transitional).
        * *WEP-PSK*: (deprecated, use WPA based security) Wired Equivalent
          Privacy.
        * *WEP-8021X*: (deprecated, use WPA based security) Dynamic WEP - WEP
          using EAP to dynamically change keys.
        * *WPA-PSK*: Class of networks using WPA (in any version) for security
          and using key derivation based on a pre-shared key (*Passphrase*).
          This class includes both WPA, WPA2 and WPA3 as well as all possible
          transitional modes (e.g. WPA-WPA2).
        * *WPA-EAP*: Similar to WPA-PSK but instead of having a pre-shared key
          it uses EAP to derive the master session key (key <!-- nocheck -->
          hierarchy used for encryption/integrity checks is derived from it
          instead of the **Passphrase** as is in the case of *WPA-PSK*).
        * *WPA2*: WPA-PSK network allowing only WPA2.
        * *WPA2-WPA3*: WPA-PSK network allowing either WPA2 or WPA3.
        * *WPA3*: WPA-PSK network allowing only WPA3.
        * *WPA2-Enterprise*: WPA-EAP network allowing only WPA2.
        * *WPA2-WPA3-Enterprise*: WPA-EAP network allowing either WPA2 or WPA3.
        * *WPA3-Enterprise*: WPA-EAP network allowing only WPA3.
        * *WPA3-Enterprise_192*: WPA-EAP network allowing only WPA3 192-bit
          mode.  Currently not supported by ChromeOS.
      Note: The transitional modes (e.g. WPA2-WPA3) are applicable either for
      the case when given BSS is configured in transitional mode or when the ESS
      is comprised of BSSes that have mixed configuration (some using WPA2
      and some using WPA3).

    * Allowed values are:

        * *WPA3-Enterprise_192*

* **SSID**
    * (optional if **HexSSID** is set, otherwise ignored) - **string**
    * Property to access the decoded SSID of a network.<br/>
      If this field is set, but **HexSSID** is not,
      its value will be UTF-8 encoded and the hex representation will be
      assigned to **HexSSID**. To configure a non-UTF-8
      SSID, field **HexSSID** must be used.<br/>
      When reading the configuration of a network, both this field and
      **HexSSID** might be set. Then this field is the
      decoding of **HexSSID**. If possible the HexSSID is
      decoded using UTF-8, otherwise an encoding is guessed on a best effort
      basis.

* **SignalStrength**
    * (optional, read-only) - **integer**
    * The current signal strength for this network in the range [0, 100],
      provided by the system. If the network is not in range this field will

    * DEPRECATED, see **Metered**.<br/>

---
  * At least one of the fields **HexSSID** or **SSID** must be present.
  * If both **HexSSID** and **SSID** are set, the values must be consistent.

offer standard configuration options for a few common configurations at this
time, and may add more later. For all others, implementation specific fields
should be used.

      when the server sends a static-challenge. If the server does not send a
      static-challenge, the client will reply with only the password (without
      any encoding). This behavior is deprecated and new configurations should
      explicitly set one of the above values.

      See the fields **Password** and
      **OTP** for configuring the password and OTP.

## Client certificate patterns

In order to allow clients to securely key their private keys and request
certificates through PKCS#10 format or through a web flow, we provide
alternative CertificatePattern types. The

### CertificatePattern type

* **IssuerCARef**
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * Array of references to certificates. At least one must have signed the
      client certificate.

* **Issuer**
    * (optional) - [IssuerSubjectPattern](#IssuerSubjectPattern-type)
    * Pattern to match the issuer X.509 settings against. If not specified, the
      only checks done will be a signature check against
      the **IssuerCARef** field. Issuer of the
      certificate must match this field exactly to match the pattern.

* **Subject**
    * (optional) - [IssuerSubjectPattern](#IssuerSubjectPattern-type)
    * Pattern to match the subject X.509 settings against. If not specified, the
      subject settings are not checked and any certificate matches. Subject of
      the certificate must match this field exactly to match the pattern.

* **EnrollmentURI**
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * If no certificate matches this CertificatePattern, the first URI from this
      array with a recognized scheme is navigated to, with the intention this
      informs the user how to either get the certificate or gets the certificate
      for the user. For instance, the array may be [
      "chrome-extension://asakgksjssjwwkeielsjs/fetch-client-cert.html",
      "http://intra/connecting-to-wireless.html" ] so that for Chrome browsers a
      Chrome app or extension is shown to the user, but for other browsers, a
      web URL is shown.

### IssuerSubjectPattern type

* **CommonName**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * Certificate subject's commonName must match this string if present.

* **Locality**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * Certificate subject's location must match this string if present.

* **Organization**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * At least one of certificate subject's organizations must match this string
      if present.

* **OrganizationalUnit**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * At least one of certificate subject's organizational units must match this
      string if present.

---
  * One field in **Subject**, **Issuer**, or **IssuerCARef**
    must be given for a [CertificatePattern](#CertificatePattern-type) typed
    field to be valid.
  * For a certificate to be considered matching, it must match all
    the fields in the certificate pattern. If multiple certificates match, the
    certificate with the latest issue date that is still in the past, and
    hence valid, will be used.
  * If **EnrollmentURI** is not given and no match is
    found to this pattern, the importing tool may show an error to the user.

    * Localized description of the APN.

* **Username**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * Username for making connections if required.

* **Password**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * Password for making connections if required.

* **Authentication**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * Type of authentication protocol for sending username and password.
      Possible values are "", "PAP", or "CHAP".

* **Language**
    * (optional, required if **LocalizedName** is provided) - **string**
    * Two letter language code for Localizedname if provided.

* **Id**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * A unique identifier for this APN. Must be a non-empty string.

* **IpType**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * The IP type of the APN. Possible values are "", "IPv4", "IPv6", or
      "IPv4orIPv6". If none is provided or the provided string is empty,
      the IP type is automatic.

* **ApnTypes**
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * The type(s) of the APN. If provided, must be a non-empty array.
      Possible values are "Default", "Attach", or "Tether".

* **Source**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * The source of the APN. Possible values are "", "Modem", "Modb", "Ui", or
      "Admin".

## Certificates

Certificate data is stored in a separate section. Each certificate may be
referenced from within the NetworkConfigurations array using a certificate
reference. A certificate reference is its GUID.

The top-level field **Certificates** is an array of
objects of [Certificate](#Certificate-type) type.

### Certificate type

* **GUID**
    * (required) - **string**
    * A unique identifier for this certificate. Must be a non-empty string.

* **PKCS12**
    * (required if **Type** is
        *Client*, otherwise ignored) - **string**
    * For certificates with
      private keys, this is the base64 encoding of a PKCS#12 file.

* **Remove**
    * (optional, defaults to *false*) - **boolean**
    * If *true*, remove this certificate (only GUID
      should be set).

* **Scope**
    * (optional, default Scope if missing) - [Scope](#Scope-type)
    * If this is given, it specifies the scope in which the certificate should
      be applied.

* **TrustBits**
    * (optional if **Type**
        is *Server*
        or *Authority*, otherwise ignored, defaults to []) - **array of string**
    * An array of trust flags. Clients should ignore unknown flags. For
      backwards compatibility, each flag should only increase the trust and
      never restrict. The trust flag *Web* implies that
      the certificate is to be trusted for HTTPS SSL identification. A typical
      web certificate authority would have **Type** set
      to *Authority* and **TrustBits** set to `["Web"]`

* **Type**
    * (required if **Remove** is *false*, otherwise ignored) - **string**
    * Allowed values are:
        * *Client*
        * *Server*
        * *Authority*
    * *Client* indicates the certificate is for
      identifying the user or device over HTTPS or for
      VPN/802.1X. *Server* indicates the certificate
      identifies an HTTPS or VPN/802.1X peer.
      *Authority* indicates the certificate is a
      certificate authority and any certificates it issues should be
      trusted. Note that if **Type** disagrees with the
      x509 v3 basic constraints or key usage attributes, the
      **Type** field should be honored.

* **X509**
    * (required if **Type** is
        *Server* or *Authority*, otherwise ignored) - **string**
    * For certificate
      without private keys, this is the X509 certificate in PEM format.

    The passphrase of the PKCS#12 encoding must be empty. Encryption of key data
    should be handled at the level of the entire file, or the transport of the
    file.

    If a global-scoped network connection refers to a user-scoped certificate,
    results are undefined, so this configuration should be prohibited by the
    configuration editor.

### Scope type
* **Id**
    * (required if **Type** is *Extension*, otherwise ignored) - **string**
    * If *Type* is *Extension*, this is the ID of the chrome extension for which
      the certificate should be applied.
* **Type**
    * (required) - **string**
    * Allowed values are:
        * *Extension*
        * *Default*
    * *Extension* indicates that the certificate should only be applied in the
      scope of a chrome extension.
      *Default* indicates that the scope the certificate applies in should not
      be restricted.


## Encrypted Configuration

We assume that when this format is imported as part of policy that
file-level encryption will not be necessary because the policy transport is
already encrypted, but when it is imported as a standalone file, it is
desirable to encrypt it. Since this file has private information (user
names) and secrets (passphrases and private keys) in it, and we want it to
be usable as a manual way to distribute network configuration, we must
support encryption.

For this standalone export, the entire file will be encrypted in a symmetric
fashion with a passphrase stretched using salted PBKDF2 using at least 20000
iterations, and encrypted using an AES-256 CBC mode cipher with an SHA-1
HMAC on the ciphertext.

An encrypted ONC file's top level object will have the
[EncryptedConfiguration](#EncryptedConfiguration-type) type.

### EncryptedConfiguration type

* **Cipher**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The type of cipher used. Currently only *AES256*
      is supported.

* **Ciphertext**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The raw ciphertext of the encrypted ONC file, base64 encoded.

* **HMAC**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The HMAC for the ciphertext, base64 encoded.

* **HMACMethod**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The method used to compute the Hash-based Message Authentication Code
      (HMAC). Currently only *SHA1* is supported.

* **Salt**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The salt value used during key stretching.

* **Stretch**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The key stretching algorithm used. Currently
      only *PBKDF2* is supported.

* **Iterations**
    * (required) - **integer**
    * The number of iterations to use during key stretching.

* **IV**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The initial vector (IV) used for Cyclic Block Cipher (CBC) mode, base64
      encoded.

* **Type**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The type of the ONC file, which must be set
      to *EncryptedConfiguration*.

---
  * When decrypted, the ciphertext must contain a JSON object of
    type [UnencryptedConfiguration](#UnencryptedConfiguration-type).
---

## String Expansions

The values of some fields, such
as **WiFi.EAP.Identity**
and **VPN.*.Username**, are subject to string
expansions. These allow one ONC to have basic user-specific variations.

### The expansions are:

* Placeholders that will only be replaced in user-specific ONC:
    * ${LOGIN\_ID} - expands to the email address of the user, but before
      the '@'.
    * ${LOGIN\_EMAIL} - expands to the email address of the user.

* Placeholders that will only be replaced in device-wide ONC:
    * ${DEVICE\_SERIAL\_NUMBER} - expands to the serial number of the device.
    * ${DEVICE\_ASSET\_ID} - expands to the administrator-set asset ID of the
      device.

* Placeholders that will only be replaced when a client certificate has been
  matched by a [CertificatePattern](#CertificatePattern-type):
    * ${CERT\_SAN\_EMAIL} - expands to the first RFC822 SubjectAlternativeName
      extracted from the client certificate.
    * ${CERT\_SAN\_UPN} - expands to the first OtherName SubjectAlternativeName
      with OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.3 (UserPrincipalName) extracted from the
      client certificate.
    * ${CERT\_SUBJECT\_COMMON\_NAME} - expands to the ASCII value of the Subject
      CommonName extracted from the client certificate.

### The following SED would properly handle resolution.

* s/\$\{LOGIN\_ID\}/bobquail$1/g

* s/\$\{LOGIN\_EMAIL\}/bobquail@example.com$1/g

### Example expansions, assuming the user was bobquail@example.com:

* "${LOGIN\_ID}" -> "bobquail"

* "${LOGIN\_ID}@corp.example.com" -> "bobquail@corp.example.com"

* "${LOGIN\_EMAIL}" -> "bobquail@example.com"

* "${LOGIN\_ID}X" -> "bobquailX"

* "${LOGIN\_IDX}" -> "${LOGIN\_IDX}"

* "X${LOGIN\_ID}" -> "Xbobquail"


## String Substitutions
The values of **WiFi.EAP.Password** and **VPN.L2TP.Password** are subject to
string substitution. These differ from the **String Expansions** section above
in that an exact match of the substitution variable is required in order to
substitute the real value.

### Example expansions, assuming the user password was *helloworld*:

* "${PASSWORD}" -> "helloworld"

* "${PASSWORD}foo" -> "${PASSWORD}foo"

## Recommended Values
When a policy is providing ONC configurations, the assumption is that all values
are mandatory and immutable. To specify values that can be overridden by a user
(e.g. proxy or username), use the **Recommended** property.

* **Recommended**
  * (optional) - **array of string**
  * The field(s) with the names in the strings in this array are to be treated
    as recommended settings. Any fields not mentioned in this array remain
    mandatory. This also means that fields that are not mentioned in the array
    and also not mentioned in the objects are mandatory and have the default
    value of the field. If not present, all fields are mandatory. Fields that
    are objects or arrays of objects included in Recommended will be ignored. In
    those cases, the nested objects should have their own Recommended fields. A
    special case is if the string "." is included in the list. When this is
    present, it means that the entire certificate or network can be forgotten or
    deleted by the user. Including the "." has no implications on the rest of
    the settings. For instance, a network may have Recommended set to [ "." ],
    in which case its settings may not be changed by the user, but the whole
    network can be forgotten by the user.  The "." is valid in a Certificate
    object and the NetworkConfiguration object, it is ignored elsewhere.


## Detection

This format should be sent in files ending in the .onc extension. When
transmitted with a MIME type, the MIME type should be
application/x-onc. These two methods make detection of data to be handled in
this format, especially when encryption is used and the payload itself is
not detectable.


## Alternatives considered

For the overall format, we considered XML, ASN.1, and protobufs. JSON and
ASN.1 seem more widely known than protobufs. Since administrators are
likely to want to tweak settings that will not exist in common UIs, we
should provide a format that is well known and human modifiable. ASN.1 is
not human modifiable. Protobufs formats are known by open source developers
but seem less likely to be known by administrators. JSON serialization
seems to have good support across languages.

We considered sending the exact connection manager configuration format of
an open source connection manager like connman. There are a few issues
here, for instance, referencing certificates by identifiers not tied to a
particular PKCS#11 token, and tying to one OS's connection manager.

## Examples

### GlobalNetworkConfiguration Example

In this example, we only allow managed networks to auto connect and
disallow any other networks if a managed network is available. We also block
the "Guest" network (hex("Guest")=4775657374) and disable Cellular services.
```
{
  "Type": "UnencryptedConfiguration",
  "GlobalNetworkConfiguration": {
    "AllowOnlyPolicyNetworksToAutoconnect": true,
    “AllowOnlyPolicyNetworksToConnect”: false,
    “AllowOnlyPolicyNetworksToConnectIfAvailable”: true,
    “BlockedHexSSIDs”: [“4775657374”],
    "DisableNetworkTypes": ["Cellular"]
  }
}
```

### Simple format example: PEAP/MSCHAPv2 network (per device)

```
{
  "Type": "UnencryptedConfiguration",
  "NetworkConfigurations": [
    {
      "GUID": "{f2c17903-b0e1-8593-b3ca74f977236bd7}",
      "Name": "MySSID",
      "Type": "WiFi",
      "WiFi": {
        "AutoConnect": true,
        "EAP": {
          "Outer": "PEAP",
          "UseSystemCAs": true
        },
        "HiddenSSID": false,
        "SSID": "MySSID",
        "Security": "WPA-EAP"
      }
    }
  ],
  "Certificates": []
}
```

Notice that in this case, we do not provide a username and password - we set
SaveCredentials to *false* so we are prompted every
time. We could have passed in username and password - but such a file should
be encrypted.

### Complex format example: TLS network with client certs (per device)

```

    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the client certificate is not sent in the ONC format, but
rather we send a certificate authority which we know will have signed the
client certificate that is needed, along with an enrollment URI to navigate
to if the required certificate is not yet available on the client.

### Simple format example: HTTPS Certificate Authority

In this example a new certificate authority is added to be trusted for HTTPS
server authentication.

### Recommended values example

In this example, the EAP Identity and Password are marked as recommended, i.e.
they can be edited by the user. All other values are mandatory.

        }
      }
    }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Chrome internal format

Internally, Chrome uses a base::Value dictionary format to represent ONC
configurations. We refer to two types of dictionaries within the code:

* **ONC Dictionary** A dictionary of key-value pairs similar to the
    dictionaries under "NetworkConfigurations" described above.

* **Managed ONC Dictionary** A dictionary of key-value pairs where the values
    are dictionaries containing values from policies and settings described
    below.

Configurations may combine policy and settings configurations.

### Merge rules

If a policy configuration exists, the following rules apply:

* **Enforced** (default): The policy value is always the effective value.
    * *Note*: User policy supersedes Device policy.
    * *Note*: If a property is not provided by policy it is treated as enforced
      and the default value is applied.
* **Recommended**: If a property appears in the [Recommended](#Recommended-Values) section,
    it is considered 'Recommended'. If a UserSetting or SharedSetting value
    exists, it can be selected as the Effective value.

### Managed ONC Dictionary format ("augmented")

Managed ONC dictionaries contain the keys described under
[Network Configuration](#Network-Configuration), however the values are
dictionaries that may include the following properties:

* **Active**: For properties that are translated from the configuration
    manager (e.g. Shill), the 'active' value currently in use by the
    configuration manager.
* **Effective**: The effective source for the property: UserPolicy, DevicePolicy,
    UserSetting or SharedSetting.
* **UserPolicy**: The value provided by the user policy if any.
* **DevicePolicy**: The value provided by the device policy if any.
* **UserSetting**: The value set by the logged in user. Only provided if
    UserEditable is true (i.e. no policy affects the property or the
    policy provided value is recommended only).
* **SharedSetting**: The value set for all users of the device. Only provided if
    DeviceEditiable is true (i.e. no policy affects the property or the
    policy provided value is recommended only).
* **UserEditable**: True if a UserPolicy exists and allows the property to be
    edited (i.e. is a recommended value). Defaults to False.
* **DeviceEditable**: True if a DevicePolicy exists and allows the property to be
    edited (i.e. is a recommended value). Defaults to False.

### Examples

Property with User policy enforced value.
```
  "Priority": {
    "Active": 3,
    "Effective": "UserPolicy",
    "UserEditable": false,
    "UserPolicy": 3,
  },
```

Property with Device policy recommended value and no setting value.
```
  "Priority": {
    "Active": 2,
    "DeviceEditable": true,
    "DevicePolicy": 2,
    "Effective": "DevicePolicy",
  },
```

Property with Device policy recommended value and a shared setting value.
```
  "Priority": {
    "Active": 1,
    "DeviceEditable": true,
    "DevicePolicy": 2,
    "Effective": "SharedSetting",
    "SharedSetting": 1,
  },
```

Property with Device policy and User policy recommended values and a user
setting selected as the effective setting.
```
  "Priority": {
    "Active": 1
    "DeviceEditable": true,
    "DevicePolicy": 2,
    "Effective": "UserSetting",
    "UserEditable": true,
    "UserPolicy": 3,
    "UserSetting": 1
  },
```

## Mojo format

Chrome provides a mojo API for ONC properties:
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chromeos/services/network_config/public/mojom/cros_network_config.mojom

The mojo API uses a simplified structure for managed properties based on the
following assumptions:

* Settings UI and other clients are only interested in the active value and
  the source of the active / effective value.
* Preserving non policy settings is only interesting if they are the active
  value. i.e. if a policy value is enforced or a recommended value is used, it
  is not necessary to preserve any other settings values.

In this simplified format, a descriptive enum is used to describe the effective
policy source and whether it is enforced or recommended.

The conversion code can be found in cros_network_config.cc:GetManagedDictionary
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chromeos/ash/services/network_config/cros_network_config.cc

```
enum PolicySource {
  // The property is not controlled by policy.
  kNone,
  // The property value came from a user policy and is enforced.
  kUserPolicyEnforced,
  // The property value came from a device policy and is enforced.
  kDevicePolicyEnforced,
  // The property value came from a user policy and is recommended.
  kUserPolicyRecommended,
  // The property value came from a device policy and is recommended.
  kDevicePolicyRecommended,
  // The property value came from an extension.
  kActiveExtension,
};

struct ManagedString {
  string active_value;
  PolicySource policy_source = kNone;
  string? policy_value;
};
```

### Examples

Property with User policy enforced value.
```
  Priority: {
    activeValue: 3,
    policySource: kUserPolicyEnforced,
    policyValue: 3
  },
```

Property with Device policy recommended value and no setting value.
```
  Priority: {
    activeValue: 2,
    policySource: kDevicePolicyRecommended,
    policyValue: 2
  },
```

Property with Device policy recommended value and a setting value.
```
  Priority: {
    activeValue: 1,
    policySource: DevicePolicyRecommended,
    policyValue: 2
  },
```

Property with Device policy and User policy recommended values and a user
setting selected as the effective setting. *Note*: The User policy overrides
the Device policy and is all that is represented here. The device configuration
is persisted in the device policy itself.
```
  Priority: {
    activeValue: 1,
    policySource: kUserPolicyRecommended,
    policyValue: 3
  },
```

## Internationalization and Localization

UIs will need to have internationalization and localizations - the file
format will remain in English.

## Security Considerations

Data stored inside of open network configuration files is highly sensitive
to users and enterprises. The file format itself provides adequate
encryption options to allow standalone use-cases to be secure. For automatic
updates sent by policy, the policy transport should be made secure. The file
should not be stored unencrypted on disk as part of policy fetching and
should be cleared from memory after use.

## Privacy Considerations

Similarly to the security considerations, user names will be present in
these files for certain kinds of connections, so any places where the file
is transmitted or saved to disk should be secure. On client device, when
user names for connections that are user-specific are persisted to disk,
they should be stored in a location that is encrypted. Users can also opt in
these cases to not save their user credentials in the config file and will
instead be prompted when they are needed.
