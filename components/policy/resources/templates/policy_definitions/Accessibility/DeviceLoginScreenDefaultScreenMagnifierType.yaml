caption: Set the default screen magnifier type enabled on the login screen
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to None turns screen magnification off at the sign-in screen.

         If you set the policy, users can temporarily turn the screen magnifier on or off. When the sign-in screen reloads or stays idle for a minute, it reverts to its original state.

        If not set, the screen magnifier is off at the sign-in screen. Users can turn it on any time, and its status on the sign-in screen persists across users.

         Valid values: • 0 = Off • 1 = On • 2 = Docked magnifier on

            Note: <ph name="DEVICE_LOGIN_SCREEN_SCREEN_MAGNIFIER_TYPE_POLICY_NAME">DeviceLoginScreenScreenMagnifierType</ph> overrides this policy if the former is specified.
