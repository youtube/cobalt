caption: Set location to save Camera app photos.
desc: |-
  Sets the directory where pictures and videos captured by the camera are being saved.
  The user can't change it and the photos are always saved to the defined directory.

  The policy uses same format as <ph name="DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY_POLICY_NAME">DownloadDirectory</ph> policy.
  The location could be set to either local filesystem or <ph name="GOOGLE_DRIVE_NAME">Google Drive</ph> (with '${google_drive}' prefix) or <ph name="MICROSOFT_ONE_DRIVE_NAME">Microsoft OneDrive</ph> (with '${microsoft_onedrive}' prefix).
  If the policy is set to empty string, it'll save the photos in the default "My files/Camera" directory.
  See a list of variables you can use ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables ).

  Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> uses the default "My files/Camera" directory to save photos.
