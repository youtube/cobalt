### Metadata

This directory contains tools for validating METADATA files present in
upstream/third party directories.

The protos/metadata_file.proto comes from Android Open Source project

https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/refs/heads/main/tools/protos/

The files in Cobalt repo need to conform to this proto schema. Cobalt specific
validation rules may be further overlaid on top of this.
