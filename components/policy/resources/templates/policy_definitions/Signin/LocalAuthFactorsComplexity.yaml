caption: Set minimum complexity for local PINs and passwords

desc: |-
  This policy configures the minimum complexity requirements for local authentication factors (PINs and local passwords) set by users on <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>.

  If this policy is not set, default to complexity level None.

  This policy's requirements are enforced when a user sets up a new local PIN/password or changes an existing one.

  The complexity levels are based on Android's password quality metrics (https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/PasswordRequirements), adapted for <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>:
  - 1 = None: A PIN/password is required, but there are no restrictions on its content or length.
  - 2 = Low: Basic complexity requirements.
  - 3 = Medium: Stricter length and character-type requirements.
  - 4 = High: Strongest complexity requirements, demanding multiple character types.

  See the help center article for detailed explanations of what each level entails for both PINs and passwords.
