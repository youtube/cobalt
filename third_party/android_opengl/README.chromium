Description:
This directory contains an ETC1 encoding/decoding API.  The source derives from
frameworks/base/opengl/include/ETC1/etc1.cpp from the Android Open Source
Project.

This library has not been reviewed by security team for handling untrusted
input.  Contact security@chromium.org for any questions.

Local modifications:
- Removed decoding.
- Generalize so that output size is independent of input size.
- Handle cases of out-of-bounds blocks along the image boundary.
- Added ARGB8888 decoding option.
