caption: Set a custom enterprise label for a managed browser
default: null
desc: |-
  This policy controls a custom label used to indicate a managed browser. For managed browsers, this label will be shown in a management disclaimer on a footer on the New Tab page. The custom label will not be translated.

  When this policy is applied, any strings that surpass 16 characters will be truncated with a “...” Please refrain from using extended names.

  Note that this policy is only applied for managed browsers, so it will have no effect for managed users on unmanaged browsers.
