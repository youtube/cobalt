default: true

  When enabled the User-Agent Client Hints GREASE Update feature aligns the User-Agent GREASE algorithm with the latest spec.
        The updated spec may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain. See the spec for more information: https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#grease
        If this policy is enabled or not set, the browser will decide which User-Agent GREASE algorithm to use. If the policy is disabled the prior User-Agent GREASE algorithm is used.
        This policy is a temporary measure and will be removed in a future release.
