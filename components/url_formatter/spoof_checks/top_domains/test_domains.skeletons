# This list contains top bucket domains followed by the remaining domains.
# These are separated by ###END_TOP_BUCKET### line.

# For the top bucket domains, each row has three columns: full skeleton,
# skeleton without label separators (e.g. '.' and '-'), and the domain itself.

# For the remaining domains, each row has two columns: full skeleton and the
# domain itself.

# Each entry is the skeleton of a top domain for the confusability check
# in components/url_formatter/url_formatter.cc.
