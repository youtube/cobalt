      Test page for saving page feature

  <body>
    When this page is loaded over HTTP (i.e. via embedded_test_server() from a
    browser test), then it should be denied access to local resources, like the
    file: URI from the img tag below.  This test verifies that access to the
    file: URI will also be forbidden when saving all resources of the page
    during Save-Page-As-Complete-HTML.
    <img id="resource1"
         src="file:///path-to-be-set-at-test-runtime/should-not-save.txt"></img>
