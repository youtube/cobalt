caption: Allowed Kerberos encryption types
deprecated: true
default: 1
desc: |-
  Setting the policy designates which encryption types are allowed when requesting Kerberos tickets from a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> server.

  Setting the policy to:

  * All allows the AES encryption types aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 and aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96, as well as the RC4 encryption type rc4-hmac. AES takes precedence if the server supports AES and RC4 encryption types.

  * Strong or leaving it unset allows only the AES types.

  * Legacy allows only the RC4 type. RC4 is insecure. It should only be needed in very specific circumstances. If possible, reconfigure the server to support AES encryption.
