This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Rejection of detailsPromise must abort the update with an 'AbortError' DOMException. promise_rejects_dom: badDetails must cause acceptPromise to reject with expectedError function "function() { throw e }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'show' on 'PaymentRequest': Already called show() once" that is not a DOMException AbortError: property "code" is equal to 11, expected 20
FAIL Total in the update is a string, so converting to IDL must abort the update with a TypeError. promise_rejects_js: badDetails must cause acceptPromise to reject with expectedError function "function() { throw e }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'show' on 'PaymentRequest': Already called show() once" ("InvalidStateError") expected instance of function "function TypeError() { [native code] }" ("TypeError")
FAIL Total is recursive, so converting to IDL must abort the update with a TypeError. promise_rejects_js: badDetails must cause acceptPromise to reject with expectedError function "function() { throw e }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'show' on 'PaymentRequest': Already called show() once" ("InvalidStateError") expected instance of function "function TypeError() { [native code] }" ("TypeError")
FAIL Updating with a negative total results in a TypeError. promise_rejects_js: badDetails must cause acceptPromise to reject with expectedError function "function() { throw e }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'show' on 'PaymentRequest': Already called show() once" ("InvalidStateError") expected instance of function "function TypeError() { [native code] }" ("TypeError")
FAIL Updating with a displayItem with an invalid currency results in RangeError. promise_rejects_js: badDetails must cause acceptPromise to reject with expectedError function "function() { throw e }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'show' on 'PaymentRequest': Already called show() once" ("InvalidStateError") expected instance of function "function RangeError() { [native code] }" ("RangeError")
FAIL Must throw a RangeError when a modifier's total item has an invalid currency. promise_rejects_js: badDetails must cause acceptPromise to reject with expectedError function "function() { throw e }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'show' on 'PaymentRequest': Already called show() once" ("InvalidStateError") expected instance of function "function RangeError() { [native code] }" ("RangeError")
FAIL Must throw a RangeError when a modifier display item has an invalid currency. promise_rejects_js: badDetails must cause acceptPromise to reject with expectedError function "function() { throw e }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'show' on 'PaymentRequest': Already called show() once" ("InvalidStateError") expected instance of function "function RangeError() { [native code] }" ("RangeError")
FAIL Must throw as Modifier has a recursive dictionary. promise_rejects_js: badDetails must cause acceptPromise to reject with expectedError function "function() { throw e }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'show' on 'PaymentRequest': Already called show() once" ("InvalidStateError") expected instance of function "function TypeError() { [native code] }" ("TypeError")
