caption: Specify a list of plugins that the user can enable or disable
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy is deprecated. Please use the <ph name="DEFAULT_PLUGINS_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultPluginsSetting</ph> to control the availability of the Flash plugin and <ph name="ALWAYS_OPEN_PDF_EXTERNALLY_POLICY_NAME">AlwaysOpenPdfExternally</ph> to control whether the integrated PDF viewer should be used for opening PDF files.

        Specifies a list of plugins that user can enable or disable in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        The wildcard characters '*' and '?' can be used to match sequences of arbitrary characters. '*' matches an arbitrary number of characters while '?' specifies an optional single character, i.e. matches zero or one characters. The escape character is '\', so to match actual '*', '?', or '\' characters, you can put a '\' in front of them.

        If you enable this setting, the specified list of plugins can be used in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>. Users can enable or disable them in 'about:plugins', even if the plugin also matches a pattern in DisabledPlugins. Users can also enable and disable plugins that don't match any patterns in DisabledPlugins, DisabledPluginsExceptions and EnabledPlugins.

        This policy is meant to allow for strict plugin blocking where the 'DisabledPlugins' list contains wildcarded entries like disable all plugins '*' or disable all Java plugins '*Java*' but the administrator wishes to enable some particular version like 'IcedTea Java 2.3'. This particular versions can be specified in this policy.

        Note that both the plugin name and the plugin's group name have to be exempted. Each plugin group is shown in a separate section in about:plugins; each section may have one or more plugins. For example, the "Shockwave Flash" plugin belongs to the "Adobe Flash Player" group, and both names have to have a match in the exceptions list if that plugin is to be exempted from the blocklist.

        If this policy is left not set any plugin that matches the patterns in the 'DisabledPlugins' will be locked disabled and the user won't be able to enable them.
