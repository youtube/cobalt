# This file lists WPTs that should run against chrome via chromedriver. Tests
# should run in this configuration if they depend on the `//chrome` layer.
# This is not preferred since running WPTs with headless shell is generally
# faster. Chromedriver tests should not be listed in either of the files as
# they are handled separately and always run with chrome new headless.
