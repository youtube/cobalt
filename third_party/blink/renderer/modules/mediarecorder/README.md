# Media Stream Recording API

This folder contains the implementation of the [W3C MediaStream Recording API].
Image Capture was shipped in Chrome 49 (Mar 2016) -- support in other browsers
can be found in the [CanIUse] entry.

Encoding video uses hardware accelerated capabilities where possible: check
[Encode Accelerator Implementation Status] for the current situation.

## API Mechanics

A `MediaRecorder` uses a `MediaStream` as its source of data. The stream may
originate from a camera, microphone, `<canvas>`, `<video>` or `<audio>` tag,
remote `PeerConnection`, web audio `Node` or content capture (such as the
screen, a window or a tab).

### Construction Options

The `MediaRecorder()` constructor accepts an optional [`MediaRecorderOptions`]
dictionary giving hints as to how to carry out the encoding:

- `mimeType` indicates which container and codec to use, e.g.
 `video/webm;codecs="vp9"` or `video/x-matroska;codecs="avc1"` (see the specific
 [isTypeSupported()] test).

  Chrome will select the best encoding format if `mimeType` is left
  unspecified; in particular, it will select a hardware accelerated encoder if
  available. (The actual encoding format can be found in `ondataavailable`
 `Blob`s type).

- Users can vary the target encoding bitrate to accommodate different scenes and
CPU loads via the different bitrate members.

### Recording

Once a `MediaRecorder` is created, recording can begin with `start()`.

This method accepts an optional `timeslice` parameter. Chrome will buffer this
much of the encoded result (in milliseconds). If unspecified Chrome will buffer
as much as possible. A value of 0 will cause as little buffering as possible.

Encoded chunks are received via the `ondataavailable` event, following the
cadence specified by the `timeslice`. If `timeslice` is unspecified, the buffer
can be flushed using `requestData()` or `stop()`.  `event.data` contains the
recorded `Blob`.

## Implementation in Chromium

This API is structured around the [MediaRecorder class], which owns a
[`MediaRecorderHandler`] which in turn owns a number of
`VideoTrackRecorder`/`AudioTrackRecorder`s and a single `WebmMuxer`.
[`VideoTrackRecorder`]s are codec specific and encapsulate the necessary resources
to get the job done.  All this is illustrated in the [diagram] below.

## Other topics

### Can `MediaRecorder` record stereo?

Yes it can, but Chrome's implementation of audio streams doesn't support this
format, see [crbug/706013] and [crbug/596182].

### The produced recording doesn't have duration or is not seekable

This is by design of the webm live format and is tracked in [crbug/642012]. The
alternative is to use a Javascript library to reconstruct the Cues (see the
[discussion] in the Spec), or feed the individual recorded chunks into a
`<video>` via a `SourceBuffer`.
