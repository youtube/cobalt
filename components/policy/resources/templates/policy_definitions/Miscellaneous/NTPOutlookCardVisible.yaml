caption: Show Outlook Calendar card on the New Tab Page
default: false
desc: |- # TODO(crbug.com/376287682): insert HC article link
  This policy controls the visibility of the Outlook Card on the New Tab Page. The card will only be displayed on the New Tab Page if the policy is enabled and your organization authorized the usage of the Outlook Calendar data in the browser.

  The Outlook card shows the next calendar event, along with a glanceable look at the rest of the day's meetings. It aims to address the issue of context switching and enhance productivity by giving users a shortcut to their next meeting.

  The Microsoft Outlook card will require additional admin configuration. For detailed information on connecting the Chrome New Tab Page Card to Outlook, please see help article.

  If the <ph name="NTPCARDSVISIBLE">NTPCardsVisible</ph> is disabled, the Outlook Card will not be shown. If <ph name="NTPCARDSVISIBLE">NTPCardsVisible</ph> is enabled, the Outlook card will be shown if this policy is also enabled and there is data to be shown. If <ph name="NTPCARDSVISIBLE">NTPCardsVisible</ph> is unset, the Outlook card will be shown if this policy is also enabled, the user has the card enabled in Customize Chrome, and there is data to be shown.
