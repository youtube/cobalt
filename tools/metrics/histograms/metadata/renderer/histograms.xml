    difference between the timestamp of the pointerevent provided to the API,
    and the final point of the trail that is drawn. Points are forwarded from
    the browser to viz when this API is being used, so viz will have points
    ahead of what the app provided the API, and they are used to draw the trail.
    This metric measures how much closer the trail is to the pointer, in time,
    compared to the last API drawn point. The bigger the histogram's value, the
    closer Delegated Ink got us to the last pointer position.
