caption: Enterprise printer configuration file
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Setting this policy configure enterprise printers. Its format matches the <ph name="NATIVE_PRINTERS_POLICY_NAME">NativePrinters</ph> dictionary, with an additional required <ph name="ID_FIELD">"id"</ph> or <ph name="GUID_FIELD">"guid"</ph> field for each printer for allow listing or deny listing. The file size can't exceed 5MB and is in JSON format. A file with about 21,000 printers encodes as a 5MB file. The cryptographic hash helps verify download integrity. The file is downloaded, cached, and redownloaded when the URL or the hash changes. <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> downloads the file for printer configurations and makes printers available along with <ph name="BULK_PRINTERS_ACCESS_MODE_POLICY_NAME">NativePrintersBulkAccessMode</ph>, <ph name="BULK_PRINTERS_WHITELIST">NativePrintersBulkWhitelist</ph>, and <ph name="BULK_PRINTERS_BLACKLIST">NativePrintersBulkBlacklist</ph>.

        This policy has no effect on whether users can configure printers on individual devices. It is intended to be supplementary to the configuration of printers by individual users.

        If you set the policy, users can't change it.

        This policy is deprecated, please use <ph name="PRINTERS_BULK_CONFIGURATION_POLICY_NAME">PrintersBulkConfiguration</ph> instead.
