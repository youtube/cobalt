# TODO(crbug.com/353942917): Burn down this list to the minimal reasonable

# Intentionally kept:
#   bad-indentation: Formatting is auto-handled by yapf and there is expected to
#     be a mixture of 2 and 4-space files due to a change in style guidelines.
#   duplicate-code: Finds many non-actionable "duplicate" entries such as
#     similar imports in multiple files.
#   fixme: TODOs are perfectly valid as long as they're associated with a bug.
#   missing-docstring: Docstrings should be encouraged, but also should not be
#     required for every single function and method.
#   wrong-import-position: We often need to add directories to PATH before
#     importing, which causes this check to fail.
