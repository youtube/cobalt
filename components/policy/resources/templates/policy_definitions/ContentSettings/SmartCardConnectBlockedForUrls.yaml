caption: Block Smart Card connection by Isolated Apps
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies which Isolated Web Apps (IWAs) won't be able to connect to smart card readers (users won't even be prompted for permission). This policy accepts wildcards - for example, <ph name="ALL_ISOLATED_WEB_APPS">*</ph> will block access for all IWAs.

  This policy is overridden by <ph name="POLICY_NAME">SmartCardConnectAllowedForUrls</ph>; in particular, a blocklist value of <ph name="ALL_ISOLATED_WEB_APPS">*</ph> means that all IWAs will be unable to connect to smart card readers (users won't even be prompted for permission) except for the ones listed in <ph name="POLICY_NAME">SmartCardConnectAllowedForUrls</ph>.

  By default, IWAs that specify Smart Card permissions within their manifest can connect to smart cards provided that user grants the permission interactively per-reader.
