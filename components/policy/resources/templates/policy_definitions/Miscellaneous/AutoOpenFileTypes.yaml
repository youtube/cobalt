caption: List of file types that should be automatically opened on download
desc: |-
  List of file types that should be automatically opened on download. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type, so list "txt" instead of ".txt".

  Files with types that should be automatically opened will still be subject to the enabled safe browsing checks and won't be opened if they fail those checks.

  If this policy isn't set, only file types that a user has already specified to automatically be opened will do so when downloaded.

  On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph>, this policy is only available on instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> domain, joined to <ph name="MS_AAD_NAME">Microsoft® Azure® Active Directory®</ph> or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>.
