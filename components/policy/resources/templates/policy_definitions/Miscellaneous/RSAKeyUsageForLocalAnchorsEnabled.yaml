caption: Check RSA key usage for server certificates issued by local trust anchors
default: null
desc: |-
  The X.509 key usage extension declares how the key in a certificate may be
  used. Such instructions ensure certificates are not used in an unintended
  context, which protects against a class of cross-protocol attacks on HTTPS and
  other protocols. For this to work, HTTPS clients must check that server
  certificates match the connection's TLS parameters.

  If this policy is set to enabled,
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will perform this check.
  This helps prevent attacks where an attacker manipulates the browser into
  interpreting a key in ways that the certificate owner did not intend.

  If this policy is set to disabled,
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will skip this check in
  HTTPS connections that both negotiate TLS 1.2 and use an RSA certificate that
  chains to a local trust anchor. Examples of local trust anchors include
  policy-provided or user-installed root certificates. In all other cases, the
  check is performed independent of this policy's setting.

  If the policy is not configured,
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will behave as if the
  policy is disabled.

  This policy is available for administrators to preview the behavior of a
  future release, which will enable this check by default. At that point, this
  policy will remain temporarily available for administrators that need more
  time to update.

  Connections which fail this check will fail with the error
  ERR_SSL_KEY_USAGE_INCOMPATIBLE. Sites which fail with this error likely have a
  misconfigured certificate. Modern ECDHE_RSA cipher suites use the
  "digitalSignature" key usage option, while legacy RSA decryption cipher suites
  use the "keyEncipherment" key usage option. If unsure, adminstrators should
  include both in RSA certificates meant for HTTPS.
