<histogram name="Shortcuts.Creation.Result" enum="ShortcutCreatorResult"
    expires_after="2025-03-23">
  <owner>dibyapal@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>pwa-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Records if shortcut creation on the user's desktop was successful. This is
    only recorded if the user accepts the shortcut creation dialog. Shortcut
    creation occurs when the user creates a shortcut to a webpage using the
    3-dot-menu -&gt; &quot;Save and Share&quot; -&gt; &quot;Create
    Shortcut&quot; functionality.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Shortcuts.CreationTask.Result"
    enum="ShortcutCreationTaskResult" expires_after="2025-03-23">
  <owner>dibyapal@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>pwa-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the result of shortcut creation for the web &quot;shortcut&quot;
    feature. This is recorded when the user attempts to create a shortcut using
    the 3-dot-menu -&gt; &quot;Save and Share&quot; -&gt; &quot;Create
    Shortcut&quot; functionality. If a shortcut cannot be created, the stage at
    which it failed is logged as an error here.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Shortcuts.Icons.StorageCount" units="count"
    expires_after="2025-05-04">
  <owner>dmurph@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>pwa-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    This is a record of the number of files in the directory used to store icons
    for the web &quot;shortcut&quot; feature. This is recorded when the user
    creates a shortcut using the 3-dot-menu -&gt; &quot;Save and Share&quot;
    -&gt; &quot;Create Shortcut&quot; functionality. If this metric shows that
    users have a large number of files here, then a new design or some other
    mitigation may be required. This requires the kShortcutsNotApps feature to
    be enabled.
