    <description summary="extends wl_keyboard with events for device configuration change">
      Allows a wl_keyboard to notify device configuration change events of
      the keyboard to the client.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding uinterface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and uinterface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

        Notify that the user installed a new keyboard layout. This doesn't
        mean the user is switching to this layout. Actual switch will be
        notified through `layout_change` event.

        This event provides a file descriptor to the client which can be
        memory-mapped to provide a keyboard mapping description. Difference
        between this and wl_keyboards's `keymap` event is this event will be sent both
        on client startup and also on newly-added layout (not on layout switch).
