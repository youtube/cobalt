// A transition object is used to represent a transformation of a start state
// |S| into a terminating state |T|. The transition can fail, in which case the
// result is an error state |E|.
//
// The transition centers around a state object of type |S|, which will become
// an instance of |T| if the transition succeeds, and an error |E| if it does
// not.
//
// The transition itself is in one of three modes:
//  - A "pending" transition has been created and is waiting for control of the
//    |S| instance to begin the transition.
//  - A "working" transition has control of the |S| object, and is transforming
//    it into |T|. There is no guarantee at this point about the existence of an
//    |S| or |T| instance.
//  - A "final" transition has completed, and either succeeded (in which case
//    a |T| instance exists) or failed (in which case |T| does not exist and an
//    |E| error has been generated.
//
// Once the transition is "final" no further work is possible and the transition
// can be deleted.
