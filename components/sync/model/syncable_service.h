  // hasn't been called yet, meaning you don't have a SyncChangeProcessor. The
  // sync subsystem will respond soon after invoking Run() on your flare by
  // calling MergeDataAndStartSyncing.

  // history page is open, you want remote sessions data to be available there.
  // 3) You want to signal to sync that it's safe to start now that the
  // browser's IO-intensive startup process is over. The DataType parameter is
  // included so that the receiving end can track usage and timing statistics,
  // make optimizations or tradeoffs by type, etc.
