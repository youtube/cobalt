  <summary>
    Chrome OS histogram that keeps track of cases where the user_allowlist
    policy is not present, forcing us to use the user_whitelist policy instead.
    We emit false to this histogram when user_allowlist is present. We emit true
    when user_allowlist is not present and user_whitelist is present and used as
    fallback. These checks happen during login policies decoding, which occurs
    every time device settings are loaded or stored.
