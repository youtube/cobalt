This directory contains a partial snapshot of the libxml library
with the patches in the patches/ directories applied.
See the files in that directory for discussion of their effects.

Current version: 2.7.7.

To import a new snapshot of libxml:

- Visit http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html and download the latest source
  distribution.
- Copy the files into this directory, omitting files which have been omitted
  here.  E.g.:  for i in $(find . -type f); do cp ../libxml-newver/$i $i; done
  This should clobber all local changes to this directory.
- Apply the patches in patches/ and fix any problems.
  UPDATE THOSE PATCHES OR EVAN WILL HUNT YOU DOWN.
- On a Linux system,
    $ cd linux
    $ ../configure --without-iconv --without-ftp --without-http
  to generate config.h and include/libxml/xmlversion.h for Linux.
- On a Mac,
    $ cd mac
    $ ../configure --without-iconv --without-ftp --without-http
  to generate config.h and include/libxml/xmlversion.h for Macs.
- On Windows, run build/generate-win32-headers.bat to re-generate config.h and
  include/libxml/xmlversion.h for Windows builds.
- Update this README to reflect the new version number.
