# Overview
# ========
#
# This file lists reviewers for CLs that add or interact with `unsafe` Rust.
# See `//docs/rust-unsafe.md` for Chromium policy for `unsafe` Rust code.

# How to assign reviews
# =====================
#
# Consider assigning reviews to chrome-unsafe-rust-reviews@google.com, rather
# than to a specific reviewer. This helps distribute review load and knowledge
# more evenly amongst the team. Automation will select a random reviewer and
# reassign the review within ~5 minutes. Googlers can read more about this at
# go/gwsq-gerrit.
chrome-unsafe-rust-reviews@google.com

# `OWNERS` boilerplate to copy
# ============================
#
# This file should be used to set ownership of `.rs` files that contain
# `unsafe` Rust code as follows:
#
#     ```
#     # In //foo/bar/OWNERS file:
#     per-file unsafe_module.rs=set noparent
#     per-file unsafe_module.rs=file://third_party/rust/UNSAFE_REVIEW_OWNERS
#     ```
#
# Depending on how well the `unsafe` code is encapsulated, it may be necessary
# to add other `.rs` files from the same crate, even if those other Rust
# modules don't use `unsafe` themselves.

# Actual list of reviewers
# ========================
#
# The find-owners plugin does not support groups, so the actual `unsafe` Rust
# reviewers are listed below but tagged with {LAST_RESORT_SUGGESTION} so that
# Gerrit will preferentially suggest the gwsq review alias above.
#
# Please keep this list alphabetized and in sync with the gwsq config (see
# go/chrome-ipc-review).
dcheng@chromium.org            #{LAST_RESORT_SUGGESTION}
lukasza@chromium.org           #{LAST_RESORT_SUGGESTION}
# TODO: Announce gwsq alias to `unsafe-rust-in-chrome@google.com` and add
# other volunteers here.
