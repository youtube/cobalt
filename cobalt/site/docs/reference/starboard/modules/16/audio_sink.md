# Starboard Module Reference: `audio_sink.h`

Provides an interface to output raw audio data.

## Macros

### kSbAudioSinkInvalid

Well-defined value for an invalid audio sink.

## Typedefs

### SbAudioSink

An opaque handle to an implementation-private structure representing an audio
sink.

#### Definition

```
typedef struct SbAudioSinkPrivate* SbAudioSink
```

### SbAudioSinkConsumeFramesFunc

Callback used to report frames consumed. The consumed frames will be removed
from the source frame buffer to free space for new audio frames.

#### Definition

```
typedef void(* SbAudioSinkConsumeFramesFunc) (int frames_consumed, void *context)
```

### SbAudioSinkFrameBuffers

An array of frame buffers. For interleaved audio streams, there will be only one
element in the array. For planar audio streams, the number of elements in the
array equal to the number of channels.

#### Definition

```
typedef void** SbAudioSinkFrameBuffers
```

### SbAudioSinkUpdateSourceStatusFunc

Callback being called periodically to retrieve the status of the audio source.
The first two output parameters indicating the filling level of the audio frame
buffer passed to SbAudioSinkCreate as `frame_buffers`. As `frame_buffers` is a
circular buffer, `offset_in_frames` can be used to calculate the number of
continuous frames towards the end of the buffer. The audio sink can play the
frames only when `is_playing` is true. It should pause the playback when
`is_playing` is false. The audio sink may cache certain amount of audio frames
before start playback. It will start playback immediately when `is_eos_reached`
is true even if the amount of cached audio frames are not enough as no more
frames will be appended into the buffer when `is_eos_reached` is true. It is
possible for a host to set `is_eos_reached` to false after setting it to true,
usually this is caused by a seek. All parameters except `context` cannot be
NULL. Note that this function only reports the status of the source, it doesn't
remove audio data from the source frame buffer.

#### Definition

```
typedef void(* SbAudioSinkUpdateSourceStatusFunc) (int *frames_in_buffer, int *offset_in_frames, bool *is_playing, bool *is_eos_reached, void *context)
```

## Functions

### SbAudioSinkCreate

Creates an audio sink for the specified `channels` and `sampling_frequency_hz`,
acquires all resources needed to operate the audio sink, and returns an opaque
handle to the audio sink.

If the particular platform doesn't support the requested audio sink, the
function returns `kSbAudioSinkInvalid` without calling any of the callbacks. If
there is a platform limitation on how many audio sinks can coexist
simultaneously, then calls made to this function that attempt to exceed that
limit must return `kSbAudioSinkInvalid`. Multiple calls to SbAudioSinkCreate
must not cause a crash.

`channels`: The number of audio channels, such as left and right channels in
stereo audio. `sampling_frequency_hz`: The sample frequency of the audio data
being streamed. For example, 22,000 Hz means 22,000 sample elements represents
one second of audio data. `audio_sample_type`: The type of each sample of the
audio data – `int16`, `float32`, etc. `audio_frame_storage_type`: Indicates
whether frames are interleaved or planar. `frame_buffers`: An array of pointers
to sample data.

*   If the sink is operating in interleaved mode, the array contains only one
    element, which is an array containing (`frames_per_channel` * `channels`)
    samples.

*   If the sink is operating in planar mode, the number of elements in the array
    is the same as `channels`, and each element is an array of
    `frames_per_channel` samples. The caller has to ensure that `frame_buffers`
    is valid until SbAudioSinkDestroy is called. `frames_per_channel`: The size
    of the frame buffers, in units of the number of samples per channel. The
    frame, in this case, represents a group of samples at the same media time,
    one for each channel. `update_source_status_func`: The audio sink calls this
    function on an internal thread to query the status of the source. It is
    called immediately after SbAudioSinkCreate is called, even before it
    returns. The caller has to ensure that the callback functions above return
    meaningful values in this case. The value cannot be NULL.
    `consume_frames_func`: The audio sink calls this function on an internal
    thread to report consumed frames. The value cannot be NULL. `context`: A
    value that is passed back to all callbacks and is generally used to point at
    a class or struct that contains state associated with the audio sink.

#### Declaration

```
SbAudioSink SbAudioSinkCreate(int channels, int sampling_frequency_hz, SbMediaAudioSampleType audio_sample_type, SbMediaAudioFrameStorageType audio_frame_storage_type, SbAudioSinkFrameBuffers frame_buffers, int frames_per_channel, SbAudioSinkUpdateSourceStatusFunc update_source_status_func, SbAudioSinkConsumeFramesFunc consume_frames_func, void *context)
```

### SbAudioSinkDestroy

Destroys `audio_sink`, freeing all associated resources. Before returning, the
function waits until all callbacks that are in progress have finished. After the
function returns, no further calls are made callbacks passed into
SbAudioSinkCreate. In addition, you can not pass `audio_sink` to any other
SbAudioSink functions after SbAudioSinkDestroy has been called on it.

This function can be called on any thread. However, it cannot be called within
any of the callbacks passed into SbAudioSinkCreate.

`audio_sink`: The audio sink to destroy.

#### Declaration

```
void SbAudioSinkDestroy(SbAudioSink audio_sink)
```

### SbAudioSinkGetMaxChannels

Returns the maximum number of channels supported on the platform. For example,
the number would be `2` if the platform only supports stereo.

#### Declaration

```
int SbAudioSinkGetMaxChannels()
```

### SbAudioSinkGetMinBufferSizeInFrames

Returns the minimum frames required by audio sink to play without underflows.
Returns -1, if `channels`, `sample_type` or `sampling_frequency_hz` is not
supported. It's user's responsibility to ensure that there're enough frames
written into audio sink during playing, or it may have underflows.

`channels`: The number of audio channels, such as left and right channels in
stereo audio. `audio_sample_type`: The type of each sample of the audio data –
`int16`, `float32`, etc. `sampling_frequency_hz`: The sample frequency of the
audio data being streamed. For example, 22,000 Hz means 22,000 sample elements
represents one second of audio data.

#### Declaration

```
int SbAudioSinkGetMinBufferSizeInFrames(int channels, SbMediaAudioSampleType sample_type, int sampling_frequency_hz)
```

### SbAudioSinkGetNearestSupportedSampleFrequency

Returns the supported sample rate closest to `sampling_frequency_hz`. On
platforms that don't support all sample rates, it is the caller's responsibility
to resample the audio frames into the supported sample rate returned by this
function.

#### Declaration

```
int SbAudioSinkGetNearestSupportedSampleFrequency(int sampling_frequency_hz)
```

### SbAudioSinkIsAudioFrameStorageTypeSupported

Indicates whether `audio_frame_storage_type` is supported on this platform.

#### Declaration

```
bool SbAudioSinkIsAudioFrameStorageTypeSupported(SbMediaAudioFrameStorageType audio_frame_storage_type)
```

### SbAudioSinkIsAudioSampleTypeSupported

Indicates whether `audio_sample_type` is supported on this platform.

#### Declaration

```
bool SbAudioSinkIsAudioSampleTypeSupported(SbMediaAudioSampleType audio_sample_type)
```

### SbAudioSinkIsValid

Indicates whether the given audio sink handle is valid.

`audio_sink`: The audio sink handle to check.

#### Declaration

```
bool SbAudioSinkIsValid(SbAudioSink audio_sink)
```
