// For search requests, this enum specifies how the user last interacted with
// the UI control. This is used for both the omnibox and NTP realbox.

// It is somewhat of a misnomer to call it OmniboxFocusType, since the enum now
// covers UI interactions unrelated to focus. But we are keeping the old name to
// match the "oft" CGI param.
//
// These values are used as HTTP CGI parameter values. Entries should not be
// renumbered and numeric values should never be reused.

  // Note that INTERACTION_CLOBBER applies in fairly limited circumstances. For
  // example, the following cases do NOT qualify and are instead marked as
  // INTERACTION_DEFAULT:
  //  - User deletes their own typed text.
  //  - User deletes the permanent text one character at a time.
  //  - User uses Cut (Ctrl+X) to delete the permanent text.
