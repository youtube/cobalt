The mission of the updater is to keep Chrome (and other software) up to date.

The updater is built from a common, platform neutral code base, as part of
the Chrome build. The updater is a drop-in replacement for Google
Update/Omaha/Keystone and can be customized by 3rd party embedders to
update non-Google client software, such as Edge.

The desktop platforms include Windows, macOS, Linux.
