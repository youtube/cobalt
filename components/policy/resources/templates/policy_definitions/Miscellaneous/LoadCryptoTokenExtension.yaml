caption: Load the CryptoToken component extension at startup
default: false
deprecated: true
desc: If set to Enabled, the built-in CryptoToken component extension is loaded at
  startup. If set to Disabled or not set, CryptoToken is not loaded at browser startup.
  This policy is meant as a temporary workaround for sites broken by `chrome.runtime`
  being undefined as a side effect of the removal of CryptoToken in M106. Websites
  must not depend on `chrome.runtime` being defined unconditionally.
