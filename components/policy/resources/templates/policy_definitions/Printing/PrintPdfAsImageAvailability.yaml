caption: Print PDF as Image Available
default: false
desc: |-
  Controls how <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> makes the Print as image option available on <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft速 Windows速</ph> and <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph> when printing PDFs.

        When printing a PDF on <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft速 Windows速</ph> or <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph>, sometimes print jobs need to be rasterized to an image for certain printers to get correct looking output.

        When this policy is set to Enabled, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will make the Print as image option available in the Print Preview when printing a PDF.

        When this policy is set to Disabled or not set <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> the Print as image option will not be available to users in Print Preview and PDFs will be printed as usual without being rasterized to an image before being sent to the destination.
