This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS decoding one UTF-8 chunk should give one output string - ArrayBuffer
PASS decoding an empty chunk should give no output chunks - ArrayBuffer
PASS an initial empty chunk should be ignored - ArrayBuffer
PASS a trailing empty chunk should be ignored - ArrayBuffer
PASS UTF-8 EOF handling - ArrayBuffer
FAIL decoding one UTF-8 chunk should give one output string - SharedArrayBuffer promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: The provided ArrayBufferView value must not be shared."
FAIL decoding an empty chunk should give no output chunks - SharedArrayBuffer promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: The provided ArrayBufferView value must not be shared."

PASS decoding a transferred Uint8Array chunk should give no output
PASS decoding a transferred ArrayBuffer chunk should give no output
