# Tests for [Aggregate Debug Reporting](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/aggregate_debug_reporting.md)

This virtual test suite covers a subset of Attribution Reporting APIs tests with
the `AttributionAggregatableDebugReporting` feature enabled.

This feature is disabled by default, so a virtual test suite is needed to enable
it via command-line flag.
