// TODO(crbug.com/1148168): This is a temporary switch to revert structured

// - all metrics are uploaded in the main UMA upload
//
// New behaviour:
// - Projects with id type 'uma' are uploaded in the main UMA uploaded
// - Projects with id type 'project-id' or 'none' are uploaded independently.
//
// Once we are comfortable with this change, this parameter can be removed.
