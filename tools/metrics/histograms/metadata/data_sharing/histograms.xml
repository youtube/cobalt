  <summary>
    Records the state of the join flow. Records one enum value for progress on
    each step of the flow. This histogram is used to understand the drop off
    rates at each step, and to estimate the frequency of errors.

  <summary>
    Records the state of the share flow. Records one enum value for progress on
    each step of the flow. This histogram is used to understand the drop off
