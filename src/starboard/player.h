// --- Functions -------------------------------------------------------------

// Creates a player that will be displayed on |window| for the specified
// |video_codec| and |audio_codec|, acquiring all resources needed to operate
// it, and returning an opaque handle to it. The expectation is that a new
// player will be created and destroyed for every playback.
//
// This function returns the created player. Note the following:
// - The associated decoder of the returned player should be assumed to not be
//   in |kSbPlayerDecoderStateNeedsData| until SbPlayerSeek() has been called
//   on it.
// - It is expected either that the thread that calls SbPlayerCreate is the same
//   thread that calls the other |SbPlayer| functions for that player, or that
//   there is a mutex guarding calls into each |SbPlayer| instance.
// - If there is a platform limitation on how many players can coexist
//   simultaneously, then calls made to this function that attempt to exceed
//   that limit will return |kSbPlayerInvalid|.
//
// |window|: The window that will display the player. |window| can be
//   |kSbWindowInvalid| for platforms where video is only displayed on a
//   particular window that the underlying implementation already has access to.
//
// |video_codec|: The video codec used for the player. If |video_codec| is
//   |kSbMediaVideoCodecNone|, the player is an audio-only player. If
//   |video_codec| is any other value, the player is an audio/video decoder.
//
// |audio_codec|: The audio codec used for the player. The value should never
//   be |kSbMediaAudioCodecNone|. In addition, the caller must provide a
//   populated |audio_header| if the audio codec is |kSbMediaAudioCodecAac|.
//
// |duration_pts|: The expected media duration in 90KHz ticks (PTS). It may be
//   set to |SB_PLAYER_NO_DURATION| for live streams.
//
// |drm_system|: If the media stream has encrypted portions, then this
//   parameter provides an appropriate DRM system, created with
//   |SbDrmCreateSystem()|. If the stream does not have encrypted portions,
//   then |drm_system| may be |kSbDrmSystemInvalid|.
//
// |audio_header|: Note that the caller must provide a populated |audio_header|
//   if the audio codec is |kSbMediaAudioCodecAac|. Otherwise, |audio_header|
//   can be NULL. See media.h for the format of the |SbMediaAudioHeader| struct.
//
// |sample_deallocator_func|: If not |NULL|, the player calls this function
//   on an internal thread to free the sample buffers passed into
//   SbPlayerWriteSample().
//
// |decoder_status_func|: If not |NULL|, the decoder calls this function on an
//   internal thread to provide an update on the decoder's status. No work
//   should be done on this thread. Rather, it should just signal the client
//   thread interacting with the decoder.
//
// |player_status_func|: If not |NULL|, the player calls this function on an
//   internal thread to provide an update on the playback status. No work
//   should be done on this thread. Rather, it should just signal the client
//   thread interacting with the decoder.
//
// |context|: This is passed to all callbacks and is generally used to point
//   at a class or struct that contains state associated with the player.
//
// |output_mode|: Selects how the decoded video frames will be output.  For
//   example, kSbPlayerOutputModePunchOut indicates that the decoded video
//   frames will be output to a background video layer by the platform, and
//   kSbPlayerOutputDecodeToTexture indicates that the decoded video frames
//   should be made available for the application to pull via calls to
//   SbPlayerGetCurrentFrame().
//
// |provider|: Only present in Starboard version 3 and up.  If not |NULL|,
//   then when output_mode == kSbPlayerOutputModeDecodeToTexture, the player MAY
//   use the provider to create SbDecodeTargets. A provider could also
//   potentially be required by the player, in which case, if the provider is
//   not given, the player will fail by returning kSbPlayerInvalid.
