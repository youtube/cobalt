Description: This project is a library for fully-homomorphic symmetric-key
encryption. It uses Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE)-based encryption to make it
possible to both add and multiply encrypted data. It uses modulus-switching to
enable arbitrary-depth homomorphic encryption (provided sufficiently large
parameters are set). RLWE is also believed to be secure in the face of quantum
computers.

Local Modifications:

Applying local modifications live in //third_party/shell-encryption/patches/
can be done by running the following commands:

$ export SHELL_PATH=<path-to-chromium>/src/third_party/shell-encryption
$ for patch in $SHELL_PATH/patches/*; do patch -s -p1 < $patch; done

In case of conflict, update those patches accordingly and save them back in
//third_party/shell-encryption/patches/.
