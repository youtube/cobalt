caption: Allow automatic fullscreen on these sites
desc: |-
  For security reasons, the
  <ph name="REQUEST_FULLSCREEN_API_NAME">requestFullscreen()</ph> web API
  requires a prior user gesture ("transient activation") to be called or will
  otherwise fail. Users' personal settings may allow certain origins to call
  this API without a prior user gesture, as described in
  <ph name="AUTOMATIC_FULLSCREEN_HELP_URL">https://chromestatus.com/feature/6218822004768768</ph>.

  This policy supersedes users' personal settings and allows matching origins to
  call the API without a prior user gesture.

  For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see
  https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.
  Wildcards, <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph>, are allowed.

  Origins matching both blocked and allowed policy patterns will be blocked.
  Origins not specified by policy nor user settings will require a prior user
  gesture to call this API.
