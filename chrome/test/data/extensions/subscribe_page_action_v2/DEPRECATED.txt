This folder contains the DEPRECATED version of the RSS Subscription Extension,
with manifest version 2. The extension has been upgraded to manifest version 3,
but deleting the v2 version would have meant fixing a number of tests in Chrome
that use it for testing basic Chrome pageAction functionality. In manifest
version 3, pageActions have been deprecated (merged with browserActions), so
these tests (and v2 of the RSS subscription extension) can most likely be
deleted. And if the decision is to re-write the tests, please use something
other than the subscribe_page_action as a test extension and deleted this
folder.

For the latest RSS Subscription Extension, please see subscribe_page_action_v3.
