caption: Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection
default: null
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means URL-keyed anonymized data collection, which sends URLs of pages the user visits to Google to make searches and browsing better, is always active.

  Setting the policy to Disabled results in no URL-keyed anonymized data collection.

  If this policy is left unset, the user will be able to change this setting manually.

  In <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> Kiosk, this policy doesn't offer the option to "Allow the user to decide". If this policy is unset for <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> Kiosk, URL-keyed anonymized data collection is always active.
  When set for <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> Kiosk, this policy enables URL-keyed metrics collection for kiosk apps.
