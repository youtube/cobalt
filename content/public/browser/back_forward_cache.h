    //
    // You should also consider whether it would make sense to instead split

    // page.
    //
    // Even though BackForwardCache is already enabled by default, it is not
    // guaranteed to preserve and cache the previous document on every
    // navigation, and even if it does, it is still possible for a cached
    // document to get discarded without it ever getting restored, so not every
    // history navigation will restore a document from the back/forward cache.
    // Thus, testing cases where a document does not get preserved and cached
    // on navigation or not restored on history navigation is completely valid.
    TEST_REQUIRES_NO_CACHING,

    // Unload events never fire for documents that are put into the
    // BackForwardCache. This is by design, as there is never an appropriate
    // moment to fire unload if the document is cached.
    // In short, this is because:
    //
    // * We can't fire unload when going into the cache, because it may be
    // destructive, and put the document into an unknown/bad state. Pages can
    // also be cached and restored multiple times, and we don't want to invoke
    // unload more than once.
    //
    // * We can't fire unload when the document is evicted from the cache,
    // because at that point we don't want to run javascript for privacy and
    // security reasons.
    //
    // An alternative to disabling the BackForwardCache, is to have the test
    // load a page that is ineligible for caching (e.g. due to an unsupported
    // feature).
    TEST_USES_UNLOAD_EVENT,

    // RenderFrameHost / RenderFrame / `blink::WebView` / RenderWidget change.
    // But when same-site BackForwardCache is enabled, the change usually does
    // happen. Even so, there will still be valid navigations that don't result
    // in those objects changing, so we should keep the test as is, just with
    // BackForwardCache disabled.
