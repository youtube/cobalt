   This policy controls whether the improved international keyboard shortcut mapping is enabled.
        This feature ensures keyboard shortcuts work consistently with international keyboard layouts and deprecate legacy shortcuts.

        If this policy is disabled, improved international keyboards shortcuts are disabled.
        If this policy is enabled, improved international keyboards shortcuts are enabled.
        If unset, this policy is enabled for managed devices and enabled for consumer-owned devices.
        Note this is only a temporarily policy to allow managed users to still be able to use deprecated legacy shortcuts. This policy will deprecate after customized keyboard shortcuts are available.
