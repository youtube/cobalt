  file or create a symlink using `AsRef<Path>` arguments

  `.`.

## [1.0.1]

### Changed

- The published package on crates.io no longer includes the tests or examples.

## [1.0.0]

  shallow copy of a remaining file, or on an archive whose CDR entries are out
  of sequence. However, it may leave an unused entry in the archive.
- Calling `abort_file()` while writing a ZipCrypto-encrypted file no longer
  causes a crash.
- Calling `abort_file()` on the last file before `finish()` no longer produces
  an invalid ZIP file or garbage in the comment.

## [0.8.1]

### Fixed

- `ZipWriter` now once again implements `Send` if the underlying writer does.

## [0.8.0]

### Changed

- [#333](https://github.com/zip-rs/zip/pull/333): disabled the default features of the `time` dependency, and also `formatting` and `macros`, as they were enabled by mistake.
- Deprecated [`DateTime::from_time`](https://docs.rs/zip/0.6/zip/struct.DateTime.html#method.from_time) in favor of [`DateTime::try_from`](https://docs.rs/zip/0.6/zip/struct.DateTime.html#impl-TryFrom-for-DateTime)
