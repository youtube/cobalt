/**
 * @fileoverview The API spec for the WebChannel messaging library.
 *
 * Similar to HTML5 WebSocket, WebChannel offers an abstraction for
 * point-to-point socket-like communication between a browser client and
 * a remote origin.
 *
 * WebChannels are created via <code>WebChannel</code>. Multiple WebChannels
 * may be multiplexed over the same WebChannelTransport, which represents
 * the underlying physical connectivity over standard wire protocols
 * such as HTTP.
 *
 * A WebChannel in turn represents a logical communication channel between
 * the client and server end point. A WebChannel remains open for as long
 * as the client or server end-point allows.
 *
 * Messages are delivered in-order and reliably over the same WebChannel,
 * and the choice of the underlying wire protocols is completely transparent
 * to the API users.
 *
 * Note that we have no immediate plan to move this API out of labs. While
 * the implementation is production ready, the API is subject to change.

 *    NETWORK_ERROR when a channel has to be aborted or closed. NETWORK_ERROR
 *    may be recovered by the application by retrying and opening a new channel.
 * 2. There may be lost messages (not acked by the server) when a channel is
 *    aborted. Currently we don't have a public API to retrieve messages that
 *    are waiting to be acked on the client side. File a bug if you think it
 *    is useful to expose such an API.
 * 3. Details of why a channel fails are available via closure debug logs,
 *    and stats events (see webchannel/requeststats.js). Those are internal
 *    stats and are subject to change. File a bug if you think it's useful to
 *    version and expose such stats as part of the WebChannel API.
 *
 * Server Error
 * 1. SERVER_ERROR is intended to indicate a non-recoverable condition, e.g.
 *    when auth fails.
 * 2. We don't currently generate any such errors, because most of the time
 *    it's the responsibility of upper-layer frameworks or the application
 *    itself to indicate to the client why a webchannel has been failed
 *    by the server.
 * 3. When a channel is failed by the server explicitly, we still signal
 *    NETWORK_ERROR to the client. Explicit server failure may happen when the
 *    server does a fail-over, or becomes overloaded, or conducts a forced
 *    shutdown etc.
 * 4. We use some heuristic to decide if the network (aka cloud) is down
 *    v.s. the actual server is down.
 *
 *  RuntimeProperties.getLastStatusCode is a useful state that we expose to
 *  the client to indicate the HTTP response status code of the last HTTP
