# For the builders directory, we only want to enable changes for everyone to the
# properties.json files, which would require an owner review for some .star file
# that resulted in the change. Once the targets spec .json files are being
# generated, this will prevent being able to modify files in
# //infra/config/targets that modifies the generated targets spec .json files
# without requiring an owner review. Directives will be added to enable those
# json files to be modified by the appropriate owners.
