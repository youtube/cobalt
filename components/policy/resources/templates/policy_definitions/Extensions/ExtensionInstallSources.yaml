caption: Configure extension, app, and user script install sources
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies which URLs may install extensions, apps, and themes. Before <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> 21, users could click on a link to a *.crx file, and <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> would offer to install the file after a few warnings. Afterwards, such files must be downloaded and dragged to the <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> settings page. This setting allows specific URLs to have the old, easier installation flow.

        Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns). Users can easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

        <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionInstallBlocklist</ph> takes precedence over this policy. That is, an extension on the blocklist won't be installed, even if it happens from a site on this list.
