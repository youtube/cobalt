caption: Default cookies setting
desc: |-
  Unless the <ph name="RESTORE_ON_STARTUP_POLICY_NAME">RestoreOnStartup</ph> policy is set to permanently restore URLs from previous sessions, then setting <ph name="COOKIES_SESSION_ONLY_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls</ph> lets you make a list of URL patterns that specify sites that can and can't set cookies for one session.

        Leaving the policy unset results in the use of <ph name="DEFAULT_COOKIES_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">DefaultCookiesSetting</ph> for all sites, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies. URLs not covered by the patterns specified also result in the use of defaults.

        While no specific policy takes precedence, see <ph name="COOKIES_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">CookiesBlockedForUrls</ph> and <ph name="COOKIES_ALLOWED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">CookiesAllowedForUrls</ph>. URL patterns among these 3 policies must not conflict.
