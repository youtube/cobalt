desc: |-
  Enable the Shared Clipboard feature which allows users to send text between Chrome Desktops and an Android device when Sync is enabled and the user is Signed-in.

            If this policy is set to true, the capability of sending text, cross device, for chrome user is enabled.

            If this policy is set to false, the capability of sending text, cross device, for chrome user is disabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, the shared clipboard feature is enabled by default.

            It is up to the admins to set policies in all platforms they care about. It's recommended to set this policy to one value in all platforms.
