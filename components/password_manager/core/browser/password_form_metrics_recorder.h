// The purpose of this class is to record various types of metrics about the
// behavior of the PasswordFormManager and its interaction with the user and
// the page. The recorder tracks events tied to the logical life of a password
// form, from parsing to having been saved. These events happen on different
// places in the code and the logical password form can be captured by multiple
// instances of real objects. To allow sharing the single recorder object among
// those, this class is refcounted. Reporting happens on destruction of the
// metrics recorder. Note that UKM metrics are reported for intervals of length
// metrics::GetUploadInterval(). Only metrics that are reported from the time
// of creating the PasswordFormMetricsRecorder until the end of current upload
// interval are recorded. Everything after the end of the current upload
// interval is discarded. For this reason, it is essential that references are
// not just kept until browser shutdown.
