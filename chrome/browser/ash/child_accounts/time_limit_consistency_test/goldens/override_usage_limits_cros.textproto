# There is a different behavior on Android and ChromeOS for the first test case
# with respect to the next_active_policy field, so they are split across two test
# suites currently, and it is considered permissible for this split to exist
# long term due to the triviality of how the difference affects each client's
# actual behavior. No other tests should be split this way.
