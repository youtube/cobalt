caption: Select DLCs (Downloadable Content) that need to be pre downloaded
desc: |-
  This policy allows to set a list of DLCs (Downloadable Content) to be downloaded as soon as possible. Downloaded DLCs are then available for all users on the device.

  This is useful when the administrator knows that a feature that requires the presence of the DLC will likely be used by the users of the device.
