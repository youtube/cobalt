This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] pad float32 4D tensor options.mode='edge'
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported padding for pad, padding for more than two dimensions only supports 'constant' mode."
[FAIL] pad float32 4D tensor options.mode='reflection'
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported padding for pad, padding for more than two dimensions only supports 'constant' mode."
[FAIL] pad float32 4D tensor options.mode='symmetric'
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported mode symmetric for pad."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
