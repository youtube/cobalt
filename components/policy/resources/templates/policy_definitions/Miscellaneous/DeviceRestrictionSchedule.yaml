caption: Specifies weekly intervals when ChromeOS devices cannot be used
desc: |-
  Specifies weekly intervals when ChromeOS devices cannot be used.

  During restricted intervals, any ongoing sessions are closed and users cannot sign in.

  Considerations:

  * Overlapping intervals are not supported.
  * The device restriction schedule uses the device's time zone.
  * To prevent users from editing their device time zone, use SystemTimezone.
  * To prevent users from editing their device time, use SystemFeaturesDisableList to disable Crosh, and URLBlocklist to block chrome://set-time.
