caption: URL of an XML file that contains URLs to load in an alternative browser.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to a valid URL has <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> download the site list from that URL and apply the rules as if they were set up with the <ph name="SITELIST_POLICY_NAME">BrowserSwitcherUrlList</ph> policy.

        Leaving it unset (or set to a invalid URL) means <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> doesn't use the policy as a source of rules for switching browsers.

        Note: This policy points to an XML file in the same format as <ph name="IE_PRODUCT_NAME">Internet Explorer®</ph>'s <ph name="IEEM_SITELIST_POLICY">SiteList</ph> policy. This loads rules from an XML file, without sharing those rules with <ph name="IE_PRODUCT_NAME">Internet Explorer®</ph>.
