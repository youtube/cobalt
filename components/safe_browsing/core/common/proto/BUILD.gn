# Because csd.proto is included from a proto file outside its own directory,
# proto_in_dir is required so that import can follow the Chromium style guide
# that all imports start from the source root.
#
# However, due to the way that protoc generates C++ code, this directive is
# also required in all build targets for protos that import csd.proto, including
# the protos in the same directory.  Those protos also need to import csd.proto
# using a path from the source root, otherwise they won't compile.
