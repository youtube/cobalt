CONSOLE WARNING: Listener added for a 'DOMNodeInserted' mutation event. This event type is deprecated, and will be removed from this browser VERY soon. Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a large risk of imminent site breakage. Consider using MutationObserver instead. See https://chromestatus.com/feature/5083947249172480 for more information.
Tests to see if registering an empty DOMNodeInserted event handler and dirtying the tree just right can cause attach re-entrancy with textarea.

Passes if doesn't crash.
