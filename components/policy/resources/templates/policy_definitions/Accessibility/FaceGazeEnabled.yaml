caption: Enable the face control accessibility feature
default: null
desc: |-
  Enable the face control accessibility feature. When face control is active, you
  can use your head to control the mouse cursor and use facial gestures to perform
  system actions. This allows you to control your device hands-free.

  If this policy is set to enabled, face control will always be enabled.

  If this policy is set to disabled, face control will always be disabled.

  If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

  If this policy is left unset, face control is disabled initially but can be enabled by the user anytime.
