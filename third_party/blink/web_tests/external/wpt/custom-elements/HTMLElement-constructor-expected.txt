  assert_equals: Should have gotten .prototype once expected 1 but got 2
[FAIL] HTMLElement constructor must only get .prototype once, calling proxy constructor via Reflect
  assert_equals: Should have gotten .prototype once expected 1 but got 2
[FAIL] HTMLElement constructor must only get .prototype once, calling proxy constructor via Reflect with no inheritance
