This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Changing a preload href should trigger a fetch
PASS Changing a preload "as" from a previously non-matching destination should trigger a fetch
PASS Changing a preload "type" (non-matching->matching) should trigger a fetch
PASS Removing a preload non-matching "type" should trigger a fetch
FAIL Removing a preload matching "type" should not trigger a fetch assert_array_equals: expected property 1 to be "timeout" but got "load" (expected array ["load", "timeout"] got ["load", "load"])
PASS Changing a preload media attribute (non matching->matching) should trigger a fetch
PASS Changing a preload media attribute (non matching->non matching) should not trigger a fetch
PASS Changing a preload media attribute (matching->matching) should not trigger a new fetch
PASS Removing a matching preload media attribute should not trigger a new fetch
PASS Removing a non-matching preload media attribute should trigger a new fetch
