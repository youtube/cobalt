    On a webpage that is eligible for Pix payments, this histogram logs the
    latency for seeing the FOP selector since a user copies the Pix payment code
    on the browser. [Frequency] Logged once per Pix payflow. Pix payflow is
    triggered at most once per page load. [Trigger] The histogram is logged when
    the Pix FOP selector is shown.

    Latency for the Pix payment code validation with

    sandboxed utility process to safely process strings from the renderer
    without compromising the browser process. The string would have already been
    verified to contain the Pix identifier prefix (0014br.gov.bcb.pix).
    [Frequency] As the Pix payflow is only allowed to be triggered once per page
    load, this metric similarly can only be logged at most once per page load.
    [Trigger] The user copies a Pix payment code to their clipboard, either
    manually for via a merchant's copy button.

    A Pix specific histogram. Emits true when a likely Pix code is copied to the
    clipboard on an allowlisted merchant website. A likely Pix code contains
    substring &quot;0014br.gov.bcb.pix&quot;, but this is logged before the code
    validation, which could thereafter fail and not trigger a PIX FOP selector
    UI. [Trigger] User copies a likely Pix code to the clipboard. [Frequency]
