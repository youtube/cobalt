    Total bytes received over the network for an HttpJob request that would be
    covered by IP Protection based on match with respect to the masked domain
    list alone. This is irrespective of token and proxy availability. Any bypass
    logic (e.g. first party to top level frame) will be considered, if set.
    These bytes will be recorded even if `EnableIpPrivacyProxy` is `false`. This
    is measured when the HttpJob is completed.

    There is no previous version of this metric. It is numbered to be in sync
    with similar metrics. Unlike PrefilterBytesRead, this metric accounts for
    all HTTP stream bytes (not just the content body), counts bytes for aborted
    jobs, and network bytes in 304 Not Modified exchanges (rather than cached
    content bodies).

  <summary>
    This histogram is emitted to when changing to a new geo, and tracks whether
    the token cache already contains tokens for the new geo.

    `IpProtectionConfigCache::SetCurrentGeo(geo_id)` is called when a geo is
    observed in the `IpProtectionProxyListManager` or
    `IpProtectionTokenCacheManager`. This metric is useful to help understand if
    token caching by geo is useful in providing tokens for when a geo shifts
    back to a previous geo that is contained within the cache.

    If the value is `Available`, it means that when the geo change was observed,
    the token cache contained some number of tokens for the new geo from a
    previous refill.

    If the value is `Not Available`, it means that the a new geo was observed,
    but there was no tokens already in the cache that matched this new geo.

    EnableIpPrivacyProxy features are enabled and a platform-dependent sign-in

  <summary>
    This metric tracks the effectiveness of token caching in IpProtection,
    especially during network transitions or non-ideal conditions. It records
    the outcome of `IpProtectionConfigCache::GetAuthToken()` requests, focusing
    on token availability and its alignment with the current or a previously
    cached geographical location. The four possible outcomes indicate successful
    token retrieval (for current or other geo), or unavailability with or
    without other cached tokens. This metric is only measured when geo caching
    is enabled.

    This histogram will only be emitted if the MaskedDomainList and

    quickly they experience the failure. Note that the metric counts requests

    This histogram is emitted when any error returned by GetTokens call into the
    BSA library. The error message is hashed into unsigned 32 bit integer. For
    more information on the possible errors from BSA see

    Records the number of IP Protection auth tokens involved in a specific event
    for {ProxyLayer}. The histogram indicates that {Event}. Recorded when tokens
    are successfully issued, spent, expired, or orphaned. Expected counts are
    typically 1 for Spent, and potentially higher for other events (up to batch
    size or cache size).

  <summary>
    Records the on-disk size of each MDL, when stored on disk (in the flatbuffer
    format). A single execution of the browser may generate multiple MDLs, such
    as for multiple experiments; each of these will be a distinct record. This
    record is emitted when the flatbuffer MDL is generated. The generated
    flatbuffer MDL may be cached and reused for multiple network service
    instances, or may be re-generated for each one.

  <summary>
    Delay between a MaskedDomainListManager being constructed and its
    UpdateMaskedDomainList method first being called (measured on entry).

    This effectively measures the duration for which the MDL is not populated
    and thus requests' eligibilities for IP Protection remain unknown.

    This histogram is only emitted when the MaskedDomainList feature is enabled.
    The histogram will not be emitted if the MDL never becomes available. It is
    emitted at most once per Network Service startup.

    This histogram can easily overflow its maximum (10 second) bucket if the
    component that stores the MDL data is not already available on disk. This
    histogram is primarily focused on the (more typical) case where such data is
    already available.

  <summary>
    Records the time required to call the `Matches` method on the MDL. This is a
    sync call that accesses a large data structure so it may require additional
    optimization.

    Note that clients without high-resolution clocks will report 0 for very
    short times.

  <summary>
    Record the size of the Masked Domain List proto in KB. Emitted when the raw
    proto bytes are received from Component Updater and parsed. The previous
    version of this histogram sometimes recorded the value in MB and was not
    usable.
