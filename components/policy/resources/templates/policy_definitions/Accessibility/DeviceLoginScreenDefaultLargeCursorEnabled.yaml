caption: Set default state of the large cursor on the login screen
default: null
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to True turns the large cursor on at the sign-in screen. Setting the policy to False turns the large cursor off at the sign-in screen.

        If you set the policy, users can temporarily turn the large cursor on or off. When the sign-in screen reloads or stays idle for a minute, it reverts to its original state.

        If not set, the large cursor is off at the sign-in screen. Users can turn it on any time, and its status on the sign-in screen persists across users.

            Note: <ph name="DEVICE_LOGIN_SCREEN_LARGE_CURSOR_ENABLED">DeviceLoginScreenLargeCursorEnabled</ph> overrides this policy if the former is specified.
