This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Start and iteration events are ordered by time
  assert_equals: Event #1 types should match (expected: animationiteration, animationstart, actual: animationstart, animationiteration) expected "animationiteration" but got "animationstart"
[FAIL] Iteration and end events are ordered by time
  assert_equals: Event #1 types should match (expected: animationiteration, animationend, actual: animationend, animationiteration) expected "animationiteration" but got "animationend"
[FAIL] Start and end events are sorted correctly when fired simultaneously
  assert_equals: Event #1 targets should match expected Element node <div style="animation: anim 100s 2"></div> but got Element node <div style="animation: anim 100s 100s"></div>
Harness: the test ran to completion.
