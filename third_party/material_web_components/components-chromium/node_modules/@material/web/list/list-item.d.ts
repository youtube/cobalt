 * @summary
 * Lists are continuous, vertical indexes of text or images. Items are placed
 * inside the list.
 *
 * @description
 * Lists consist of one or more list items, and can contain actions represented
 * by icons and text. List items come in three sizes: one-line, two-line, and
 * three-line.
 *
 * __Takeaways:__
 *
 * - Lists should be sorted in logical ways that make content easy to scan, such
 *   as alphabetical, numerical, chronological, or by user preference.
 * - Lists present content in a way that makes it easy to identify a specific
 *   item in a collection and act on it.
 * - Lists should present icons, text, and actions in a consistent format.
