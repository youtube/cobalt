    GL_KHR_parallel_shader_compile is required.

Overview

    This extension provides a same query mechanism as the COMPLETION_STATUS_KHR
    in GL_KHR_parallel_shader_compile, which indicates whether the program
    linking or shader compilation has completed. The major advantage of this
    query is that it doesn't incurs an expensive round-trip to the GPU thread.
    So it's much cheaper for polling. You can use it this way:
        glBeginQueryEXT(PROGRAM_COMPLETION_QUERY_CHROMIUM, query);
        glLinkProgram(program);
        glEndQueryEXT(PROGRAM_COMPLETION_QUERY_CHROMIUM);
        GLuint available = 0u;
        glGetQueryObjectuivEXT(query, GL_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE, &available);
        if (available)
        {
          GLuint result = 0u;
          glGetQueryObjectuivEXT(query, GL_QUERY_RESULT, &result);
        }
    If 'available' returns true, that's equivalent to COMPLETION_STATUS_KHR
    returning true. Then LINK_STATUS can be obtained from 'result'.

New Procedures and Functions
