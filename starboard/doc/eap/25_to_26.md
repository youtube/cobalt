# Migrating a platform

We use RDK as our reference platform, and performed the migration from Cobalt 25 to Cobalt 26 support for it as one of the first platforms. You can find the vast majority of the changes we needed the make in the following changelist: https://cobalt.googlesource.com/external/components/generic/cobalt/+/d7236a995f023bba1c74ad95602f460c2fa72297.

Below are the high level steps for what is needed when migrating a platform:
* Must update Starboard functions (this will mostly just involve getting rid of deprecated functions, see [starboard/CHANGELOG.md](../../../starboard/CHANGELOG.md), but you may need to modify wrappers under `//starboard/shared/modular/` if NPLB test fail).
* Some Chromium settings may cause issues. Use GN args to change these when possible, but if you need to change upstream we can talk about submitting those changes in Cobalt
* Add an args.gn file for your platform. You should likely inherit from linux-x64x11-modular/args.gn by importing it with `import("//cobalt/build/configs/linux-x64x11-modular/args.gn")`.
* Validate with NPLB test suite and by running Cobalt.
* Validate with running YTS. Ideally aim for parity with C25 results
