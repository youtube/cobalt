# Private Aggregation Report Goldens

This directory contains a set of golden files (JSON reports) that are valid
aggregatable reports generated by the Chrome client for server
interoperability testing.

The subdirectory latest/ contains files matching the current implementation,
and files matching old versions' implementations will be archived in
version_{x}/ where {x} represents a specific version string.

Each subdirectory includes a private/public key pair which are base64-encoded
and can be used to encrypt/decrypt the data. See
//third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/hpke.h for Hybrid Public Key
Encryption (HPKE).

## Keep files up to date

//content/browser/private_aggregation/private_aggregation_report_golden_unittest.cc
contains tests that run on the files for latest/ to ensure that the golden
report format matches the format produced by the current implementation
(ignoring randomness like the exact encrypted string).

## Version history

The history of report versions is listed below, with links to past commits of
documentation.

TODO: Replace past explainer links with draft spec when available.
