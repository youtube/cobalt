caption: Limit device uptime by automatically rebooting
desc: |-
  Setting the policy limits the device uptime by scheduling automatic restarts, which you can delay by up to 24 hours if a user is on the device. The policy value should be specified in seconds. Values are clamped to be at least 3,600 (one hour).

        If you set the policy, users can't change it. If not set, the device uptime isn't limited.

        Note: Automatic restarts are only on while the sign-in screen appears or during a kiosk app session.
