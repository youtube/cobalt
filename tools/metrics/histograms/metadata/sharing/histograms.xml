  <summary>
    The end-to-end time to encode a QR image.

    This metric captures end-to-end time which may include the overhead of
    spawning a utility process as well as the time needed to translate input
    bytes into QR pixels (see also the &quot;BytesToQrPixels2&quot; metric) and
    into QR image (see also the &quot;QrPixelsToQrImage2&quot; metric).

    Recorded whenever `chrome/services/qrcode_generator` generates a QR code.
    For example: when using the omnibox to share the URL via QR code, when using
    WebAuthn, or when generating an RMA.

  <summary>
    The time to translate the sequence of input bytes into a vector of QR pixels
    (this is not a QR _image_ just yet - see &quot;QrPixelsToQrImage2&quot;
    metric for that).

    Recorded whenever `chrome/services/qrcode_generator` generates a QR code.
    For example: when using the omnibox to share the URL via QR code, when using
    WebAuthn, or when generating an RMA.

    The metric is reported for only clients with high-resolution clocks (i.e.
    excludes a small percentage of Windows users population). This is okay,
    because we are mostly interested in comparing C++ vs Rust and it seems okay
    to assume that such comparison would give similar results for the filtered
    and non-filtered population.

    image (an upscaled `SkBitmap` with an optional Dino painted in the middle).

    Recorded whenever `chrome/services/qrcode_generator` generates a QR code.
    For example: when using the omnibox to share the URL via QR code, when using
