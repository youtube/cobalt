This directory contains deprecated classes, structs and typedefs, and test doubles for
those deprecated classes. New code should not import headers from this directory and no
new functionality should be added to deprecated classes and functions. 

This directory can be used as a temporary place for retiring public classes, structs and 
typedefs.
