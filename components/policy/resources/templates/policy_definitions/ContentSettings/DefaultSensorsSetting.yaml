caption: Default sensors setting
default: null
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to 1 lets websites access and use sensors such as motion and light. Setting the policy to 2 denies access to sensors.

        Leaving it unset means <ph name="ALLOW_SENSORS_POLICY_NAME">AllowSensors</ph> applies, but users can change this setting.
