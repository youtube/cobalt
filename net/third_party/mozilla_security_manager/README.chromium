Description:
This is selected code bits from Mozilla's Personal Security Manager.

The same module appears in chrome/third_party/mozilla_security_manager, so we
don't repeat the license file here.

Local Modifications:
Files are forked from Mozilla's because of the heavy adaptations necessary.
Differences are using Chromium localization and other libraries instead of
Mozilla's, matching the Chromium style, etc.
