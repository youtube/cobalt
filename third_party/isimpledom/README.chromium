DO NOT USE. This API has been deprecated and will be removed, along with
support, as soon as no longer needed for the JAWS screen reader.
See https://crbug.com/378908266.

Description:

  This directory contains the legacy ISimpleDOM API, which was previously needed
  to fully support Windows screenreaders. The definitions come directly from the
  Mozilla source repository, and consist of the following files from the
  accessible/public/msaa directory:

    ISimpleDOMDocument.idl
    ISimpleDOMNode.idl
    ISimpleDOMText.idl

  Modern screenreaders should use the Microsoft UI Automation framework or
  Microsoft Active Accessibility with IAccessible2.

Local modifications:
  None.
