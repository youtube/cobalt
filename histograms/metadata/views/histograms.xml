  <summary>
    Records the size of the ColorProviderManager cache when a new ColorProvider
    is generated. New entries are generated when a client requests a
    ColorProvider with a Key that is not in the cache. Since the cache size is
    capped, a distribution with too many results at the tail indicate that the
    cache is too small.

  <summary>
    Records the number of ColorProvider instances constructed and initialized by
    the ColorProviderManager following a NativeTheme update in a {Process}
    process. Emitted after the NotifyOnNativeThemeUpdated() event has been
    processed.

  <summary>
    Records the time spent initializing a newly constructed ColorProvider
    instance in a {Process} process. The timer starts immediately before the
    ColorProvider is constructed and emitted immediately after initialization
    (i.e. all mixers are run and the ColorMap is created).

  <summary>
    Records the time spent synchronously processing the the

    as soon as the event handler is entered and emitted when code returns from
    the event handler.
