Contains code to build an Objective-C framework which renders web content with
`[CWVWebView]`. See the exposed API in `//ios/web_view/public/*` for more
details.

NOTE: This code is not used by Chrome for iOS (`//ios/chrome`), but is rather
a separate product/embedder of the `//ios/web` rendering layer.
