caption: Enable boot on AC (alternating current)
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled keeps boot on AC on, if supported on the device. Boot on AC provides an opportunity for the system to restart from Off or Hibernate after inserting the line power.

        Setting the policy to Disabled keeps boot on AC off.

        If you set this policy, users can't change it. If not set, boot on AC is off, and users can't turn it on.
