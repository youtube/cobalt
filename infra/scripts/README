This directory contains files copied from the build repo:
 - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build.git
 - svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/tools/build

The revision is:
 - 353c0efac75463c521763f601bcbdfffc8b291a8 (git)
 - 295912 (svn)

This exists because src-side code can be easily tested on trybots
before committing, as opposed to build-side code.

Unfortunately, build-side code corresponding to this directory still
exists, so it's a fork.

The ultimate goal is to get rid of this code. No new pieces of infrastructure
should be using it. It's only here for already existing pieces that we need
to keep running.

Please see https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=506498
for more context.
