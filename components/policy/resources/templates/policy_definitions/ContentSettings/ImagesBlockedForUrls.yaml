caption: Block images on these sites
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets you set a list of URL patterns that specify sites that can't display images.

        Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="DEFAULT_IMAGE_SETTING_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DefaultImagesSetting</ph> applies for all sites, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

         For detailed information on valid <ph name="URL_LABEL">url</ph> patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. Wildcards, <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph>, are allowed.

         Note that previously this policy was erroneously enabled on Android, but this functionality has never been fully supported on Android.
