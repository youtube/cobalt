This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] ":host(:is(div .foo))" should be a valid selector
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected ":host(:is(div .foo))" but got ":host(:is())"
[FAIL] ":host(:where(div .foo))" should be a valid selector
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected ":host(:where(div .foo))" but got ":host(:where())"
[FAIL] ":is(::before)" should be a valid selector
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected ":is(::before)" but got ":is()"
[FAIL] ":where(::before)" should be a valid selector
