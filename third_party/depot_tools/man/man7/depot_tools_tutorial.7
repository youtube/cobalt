Pick an empty directory and run one of the following:

.nf

\fB$ fetch android\fR   # Chromium checkout for Android platform
\fB$ fetch ios\fR       # Chromium checkout for iOS platform
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
When the \fBfetch\fR tool completes you should have the following in your working directory:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
\fB\&.gclient\fR   # A configuration file for you source checkout
\fBsrc/\fR       # Top\-level Chromium source checkout\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
If you are on linux and fetching the code for the first time, then you\(cqll need to run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
\fB$ cd src && \&./build/install\-build\-deps\&.sh\fR
.fi
.if n \{\

And finally:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB$ gclient sync\fR
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
.sp
This will pull all dependencies of the Chromium src checkout\&. You will need to run this any time you update the main src checkout, including when you switch branches\&.

.sp
Each CL corresponds exactly with a single branch in git\&. Any time you want to begin a new CL:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB$ git new\-branch <branch_name>\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This will create and checkout a new branch named \fBbranch_name\fR which will track the default upstream branch (\fBorigin/main\fR)\&. See \fBgit-new-branch\fR(1) for more features\&.
.sp
Commit as many changes as you like to this branch\&. When you want to upload it for review, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB$ git cl upload\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This will take the diff of your branch against its upstream branch (in that case origin/main), and will post it to the \m[blue]\fBChromium code review site\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2\&.
.SH "UPDATING THE CODE"
.sp
Inevitably, you\(cqll want to pull in changes from the main Chromium repo\&. This is pretty easy with \fIdepot_tools\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB$ git rebase\-update\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This command will update all of your CLs to contain the latest code from their upstreams\&. It will also automatically clean up CLs which have been committed and a couple other nice things\&. See \fBgit-rebase-update\fR(1) for the full scoop\&.
.sp
One thing to look out for are \fImerge conflicts\fR\&. These happen for exactly the same as they do with SVN, but the experience is a little more controllable with git\&. \fBgit rebase\-update\fR will try to rebase all your branches for you, but if it encounters a merge conflict in one, it will halt and leave you in a rebase conflict state (see \fBgit-rebase\fR(1))\&. Resolving \fBgit rebase\fR merge conflicts is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but there are many good sources online (see the Prerequisites for some)\&.
.sp
Sometimes you\(cqre pretty certain that you\(cqve committed a certain branch, but \fBgit rebase\-update\fR isn\(cqt able to tell that for sure\&. This is usually because your branch doesn\(cqt rebase cleanly\&. You could just delete the branch with \fBgit branch \-D <branch>\fR, but you\(cqd like to double check the diff of your branch against its upstream before deleting it\&. If this is the case you can abort the rebase started by \fBgit rebase\-update\fR, and then run \fBgit-squash-branch\fR(1) to flatten your branch into a single commit\&. When you run \fBgit rebase\-update\fR again, you\(cqll get a (hopefully) much smaller / saner diff\&. If it turns out you were wrong about your branch being fully committed, you can use \fBgit-reflog\fR(1) to reset your branch back to where it was before\&. If the diff looks inconsequential, you can use \fBgit rebase \-\-skip\fR to ignore it, and then \fBgit rebase\-update\fR will clean it up for you\&.
.sp
Once you\(cqre done resolving all of the merge conflict, just run \fBgit rebase\-update\fR, and it will pick up where it left off\&. Once the command has finished updating all of your branches, it will return you back to the branch you started on\&.

Running \fBgit rebase\-update\fR will update all your branches, but it will not automatically run \fBgclient sync\fR to update your dependencies\&. Use caution when running \fBgit reset\fR on branches managed by \fIdepot_tools\fR\&. These tools track the set of "commits contained in the branch" from a branch\(cqs "merge point" to the current branch value\&. See \fBgit help mark\-merge\-base\fR for more discussion of the merge base\&.

.SH "MANAGING MULTIPLE CLS"
.sp
Sometimes you want to work on more than one CL at once (say, you have a CL posted for review and want to work on something else)\&. For each CL that you want to work on, just use \fBgit new\-branch <branch_name>\fR\&.
.sp
Once you start to have more than one CL at a time, it can be easy to lose your bearings\&. Fortunately, \fIdepot_tools\fR has two tools to help you out:

\fBgit-map\fR(1)
.RS 4
This tool shows you the history of all of your branches in a pseudo\-graphical format\&. In particular, it will show you which commits all of your branches are on, which commit you currently have checked out, and more\&. Check out the doc for the full details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBgit-map-branches\fR(1)
.RS 4
This tool just shows you which branches you have in your repo, and their upstream relationship to each other (as well as which branch you have checked out at the moment)\&.
.RE
.sp
Additionally, sometimes you need to switch between branches, but you\(cqve got work in progress\&. You could use \fBgit-stash\fR(1), but that can be tricky to manage because you need to remember which branches you stashed what changes on\&. Helpfully \fIdepot_tools\fR includes two tools which can greatly assist in case:
.sp
\fBgit-freeze\fR(1) allows you to put the current branch in \*(Aqsuspended animation\*(Aq by committing your changes to a specially\-named commit on the top of your current branch\&. When you come back to your branch later, you can just run \fBgit-thaw\fR(1) to get your work\-in\-progress changes back to what they were\&.
.sp
Another useful tool is \fBgit-rename-branch\fR(1)\&. Unlike \fBgit branch \-m <old> <new>\fR, this tool will correctly preserve the upstream relationships of your branch compared to its downstreams\&.
.sp
Finally, take a look at \fBgit-upstream-diff\fR(1)\&. This will show you the combined diff for all the commits on your branch against the upstream tracking branch\&. This is \fIexactly\fR what \fBgit cl upload\fR will push up to code review\&. Additionally, consider trying the \fB\-\-wordwise\fR argument to get a colorized per\-word diff (instead of a per\-line diff)\&.
.SH "MANAGING DEPENDENT CLS"
.sp
Now that you know how to manage \fIindependent\fR CLs, we\(cqll see how to manage \fIdependent\fR CLs\&. Dependent CLs are useful when your second (or third or fourth or \&...) CL depends on the changes in one of your other CLs (such as: CL 2 won\(cqt compile without CL 1, but you want to submit them as two separate reviews)\&.
.sp
Like all of the other CLs we\(cqve created, we use \fBgit-new-branch\fR(1), but this time with an extra argument\&. First, \fBgit checkout\fR the branch you want to base the new one on (i\&.e\&. CL 1), and then run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB$ git new\-branch \-\-upstream_current <branch_name>\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This will make a new branch which tracks the \fIcurrent\fR branch as its upstream (as opposed to \fIorigin/main\fR)\&. All changes you commit to this branch will be in addition to the previous branch, but when you \fBgit cl upload\fR, you will only upload the diff for the dependent (child) branch\&. You may have as many branches nested in this fashion as you like\&.
.sp
\fBgit-map\fR(1) and \fBgit-map-branches\fR(1) are particularly helpful when you have dependent branches\&. In addition, there are two helper commands which let you traverse your working copy up and down this tree of branches: \fBgit-nav-upstream\fR(1) and \fBgit-nav-downstream\fR(1)\&.
.sp
Sometimes when dealing with dependent CLs, it turns out that you accidentally based a branch on the wrong upstream, but since then you\(cqve committed changes to it, or even based \fIanother\fR branch off of that one\&. Or you discover that you have two independent CLs that would actually be much better off as dependent CLs\&. In instances like these, you can check out the offending branch and use \fBgit-reparent-branch\fR(1) to move it to track a different parent\&. Note that this can also be used to move a branch from tracking \fBorigin/main\fR to \fBlkgr\fR or vice versa\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH"
.sp
This section will demo what a typical workflow looks like when writing, updating, and committing multiple CLs\&.
