    // 2nd order least squares.  Quality: VERY GOOD.
    // Pretty much ideal, but can be confused by certain kinds of touch data,
    // particularly if the panel has a tendency to generate delayed, duplicate
    // or jittery touch coordinates when the finger is released.  This is the
    // default velocity tracker strategy.  Although other strategies are
    // available for testing and comparison purposes, this is the strategy that
    // applications will actually use.  Be very careful when adjusting the
    // default strategy because it can dramatically affect (often in a bad way)
    // the user experience.

    // 3rd order least squares.  Quality: UNUSABLE.
    // Frequently overfits the touch data yielding wildly divergent estimates
    // of the velocity when the finger is released.

    // more tolerant of errors.  Like 'lsq1', this strategy tends to
    // underestimate
    // the velocity of a fling but this strategy tends to respond to changes in
    // direction more quickly and accurately.
