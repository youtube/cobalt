  <summary>
    This metric records the duration of an image decode for the raster path in
    the compositor. It is recorded every time we decode an image. It is suffixed
    by the type of rasterization we're in (either Gpu or Software). The
    rasterization suffix is optionally prefixed by the image type (WebP, Jpeg,
    etc.) or OutOfRaster.

    Warning: Before version M78 this metric may include reports from clients
    with low-resolution clocks (i.e. on Windows, ref.
    |TimeTicks::IsHighResolution()|). Such reports will cause this metric to
    have an abnormal distribution.

    thread (&quot;Not scrolling on main (no reason)&quot;), or the main thread

    can be multiple main-thread reasons for each scroll, so the percentage of a
    reason shown in the UMA page is not the percentage of gesture scrolls with
    the reason in all gesture scrolls. The actual percentage of gesture scrolls
