# This rule prevents class merging on R$* resource classes (for example, R$anim,
# R$styleable, R$bool). This causes issues for WebView when unused resource
# stripping, since in WebView we are forced to detect which resources are unused
# by scanning the dex file for R$<res_type>.<res_name>. Having the R$* classes
# being merged together means that R$anim.foo may now be found in R$bool.foo,
# and this mistakenly will mark the foo resouce to be removed. More details in
# crbug.com/1348329.
