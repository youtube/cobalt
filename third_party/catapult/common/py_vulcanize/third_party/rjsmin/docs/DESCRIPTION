 Javascript Minifier
=====================

rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in python.

The minifier is based on the semantics of `jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford`_\.

The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at
runtime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the
same results as the original ``jsmin.c``. It differs in the following ways:

- there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment
  literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.
- Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they
  are not converted to spaces (nor to \n)
- Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except
  for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).
- "return /regex/" is recognized correctly.
- Line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly
- "+ +" and "- -" sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'
- Newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly
- Comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept optionally
- rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the
  module provides a "streamy" interface).

Since most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way faster
than the original python port of ``jsmin.c`` by Baruch Even. The speed factor
varies between about 6 and 55 depending on input and python version (it gets
faster the more compressed the input already is).  Compared to the
speed-refactored python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less
dramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs)). See the
docs/BENCHMARKS file for details.

rjsmin.c is a reimplementation of rjsmin.py in C and speeds it up even more.

Both python 2 (>=2.4) and python 3 are supported.
