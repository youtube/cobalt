caption: Automatically reboot after update
default: false
desc: |-
  Schedule an automatic reboot after a <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> update has been applied.

  When this policy is set to true, an automatic reboot is scheduled when a <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> update has been applied and a reboot is required to complete the update process. The reboot is scheduled immediately but may be delayed on the device by up to 24 hours if a user is currently using the device.

  When this policy is set to false, no automatic reboot is scheduled after applying a <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> update. The update process is completed when the user next reboots the device.

  If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

  Note: Currently, automatic reboots are only enabled while the login screen is being shown or a kiosk app session is in progress.
