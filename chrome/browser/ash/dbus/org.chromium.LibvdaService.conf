    LibvdaService is used by libvda (go/libvda), which is a shared library
    providing APIs corresponding to mojom::VideoDecodeAccelerator defined in
    video_decode_accelerator.mojom.
    libvda uses this service to ask Chrome to provide a mojo connection FD.

    libvda is linked to crosvm and used from its virtio video decoder device.
    Since crosvm is run as 'crosvm' by vm_concierge or 'root' from the command
    line, we allow these users.
