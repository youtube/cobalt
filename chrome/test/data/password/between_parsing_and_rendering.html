<!--
This page enables to simulate the following scenario:
Once a page body, but not the entire frame, is loaded, a
password form is dynamically created and added to the page
body.

Three main points to note:
1. The form only gets created after the body loads. Therefore
   the form is not registered during form parsing stage
   (as in PasswordManager::OnPasswordFormsParsed).
2. The form gets created before the rendering stage, so it gets
   registered during PasswordManager::OnPasswordFormsRendered unless
   it is hidden.
3. The form gets created after the document loads. Therefore
   the form is registered during OnDynamicFormsSeen.

The goal is to make sure that there is enough time between the form
creation and the frame load, so that OnDynamicFormsSeen is not
triggered for the created form after frame load. To achieve that,
this page contains a strange stylesheet, distilled from a much bigger
stylesheet included in the current live.com website (that's where
http://crbug.com/367768 was demonstrated). The style uses
some webkit-only rules for background properties.

  document.body.appendChild(form);
