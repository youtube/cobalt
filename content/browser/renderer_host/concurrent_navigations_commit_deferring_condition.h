// Defers/queues activations to back-forward cached or prerendered pages when
// there are pending commit RenderFrameHosts used by other navigations. This
// ensures that the activations won't delete pending commit RenderFrameHosts.
// Once there is no pending commit RenderFrameHost, the activation can be
// resumed. This is triggered from the NavigationRequest destructor of another
// navigation. See also `NavigationRequest::ResumeCommitIfNeeded()` and its
// callers.
//
// Note that there is also a slightly similar queueing operation done for
// non-activation navigations when trying to pick the final RenderFrameHost for
// the navigation. Both that and this deferring condition uses a similar
// resuming sequence, but different entry points to the deferred/queued states.
// This is OK because both methods cover mutually exclusive cases (this
// deferring condition covers activations only, and the queueing logic within
// NavigationRequest covers non-activations only). For more details, see also
// `NavigationRequest::SelectFrameHostForOnResponseStarted()` and other related
// functions.
