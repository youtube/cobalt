This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Property shape-outside value 'polygon(evenodd, -10px, -20px, -30px, -40px, -50px, -60px) margin-box'
  assert_true: 'polygon(evenodd, -10px, -20px, -30px, -40px, -50px, -60px) margin-box' is a supported value for shape-outside. expected true got false
[FAIL] Property shape-outside value 'polygon(10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%) content-box'
  assert_true: 'polygon(10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%) content-box' is a supported value for shape-outside. expected true got false
[FAIL] Property shape-outside value 'polygon(calc(10px - 0.5em), 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, calc(10px - 0.5em))'
  assert_true: 'polygon(calc(10px - 0.5em), 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, calc(10px - 0.5em))' is a supported value for shape-outside. expected true got false
