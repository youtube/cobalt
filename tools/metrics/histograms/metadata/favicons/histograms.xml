<histograms>

<histogram name="Favicons.DefaultResponse" enum="BooleanSuccess"
    expires_after="2025-11-09">
  <owner>mfacey@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>romanarora@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records whether for a requested favicon the default favicon is served. The
    favicon service is called when a favicon is requested such as through a
    navigation to chrome://favicon2.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Favicons.FallbackToHostSuccess" enum="BooleanSuccess"
    expires_after="2025-10-12">
  <owner>mfacey@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>romanarora@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records whether for a requested favicon that does not have an exact local
    match, whether the fallback to host behavior finds a valid match. The
    favicon service is called when a favicon is requested such as through a
    navigation to chrome://favicon2.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Favicons.IconSuccess.{IconSizes}" enum="BooleanSuccess"
    expires_after="2025-10-12">
  <owner>mastiz@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>pkotwicz@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records whether for a given size the favicon service successfully returned a
    favicon or not. The favicon service is called when a favicon is requested
    through a navigation to chrome://favicon2. A request for &quot;largest
    available size&quot; doesn't cause an emit to this histogram. If a request
    indicates multiple sizes of favicons are appropriate, this histogram is
    emitted multiple times (even though only one favicon is returned).

  <owner>jkrcal@chromium.org</owner>

  <summary>
    Records the size (concretely the width) in pixel of the favicon downloaded
    from Google favicon server (size 0 denotes that download has failed).

  <summary>
    Records the size (concretely the width) in pixel of the favicon that is used
    to generate a fallback style in the case when large enough favicon is not
    available (size 0 denotes that no favicon is available at all).
