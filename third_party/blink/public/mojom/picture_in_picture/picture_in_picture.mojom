// PictureInPictureService is a Document-associated interface that lives in

// support for https://wicg.github.io/picture-in-picture and manages all
// picture-in-picture interactions for Document. Picture-in-Picture allows
// a Document to display a video in an always-on-top floating window with
// basic playback functionality (e.g. play and pause).
// The window provides playback control by translating user actions into
// media.mojom.MediaPlayer messages. The MediaPlayer remote can be reset by the
// renderer even while the Picute-in-Picture session is active, indicating that
// the media player is gone. A new MediaPlayer remote can be provided later by
// an Update() message to the PictureInPictureSession object.

  //            Picture-in-Picture window.
  // player_remote: MediaPlayer remote to communicate with the renderer side.
  // surface_id: SurfaceId to be shown in the Picture-in-Picture window.
  // natural_size: Size of the video frames.
  // show_play_pause_button: Whether a play/pause control should be offered in
  //                         the Picture-in-Picture window.
  // observer: Observer to be associated with the session.

  //                video is displayed in physical pixels. This does not need
  //                to be exact; it will only be used to help the visual
