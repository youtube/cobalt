// In general, a SimpleWatcher must be "armed" in order to dispatch a single

// more details, see the documentation for ArmingPolicy and the Arm() and
// ArmOrNotify() methods below.

  // A callback to be called any time a watched handle changes state in some
  // interesting way. The |result| argument indicates one of the following
  // conditions depending on its value:
  //
  //   |MOJO_RESULT_OK|: One or more of the signals being watched is satisfied.
  //
  //   |MOJO_RESULT_FAILED_PRECONDITION|: None of the signals being watched can
  //       ever be satisfied again.
  //
  //   |MOJO_RESULT_CANCELLED|: The watched handle has been closed. No further
  //       notifications will be fired, as this equivalent to an implicit
  //       CancelWatch().
  //
  // Note that unlike the first two conditions, this callback may be invoked
  // with |MOJO_RESULT_CANCELLED| even while the SimpleWatcher is disarmed.

    //
    // This provides a reasonable approximation of edge-triggered behavior,
    // mitigating (but not completely eliminating) the potential for redundant
    // notifications.
    //
    // NOTE: It is important when using AUTOMATIC policy that your ReadyCallback
    // always attempt to change the state of the handle (e.g. read available
    // messages on a message pipe.) Otherwise this will result in a potentially
    // large number of avoidable redundant tasks.

    // the SimpleWatcher as soon as it becomes possible to do so again.
