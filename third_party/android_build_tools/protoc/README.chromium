Description:
protobuf library's protoc compiler (prebuilt release). This is used by the
chrome android gn targets to compile javalite protobufs (i.e. those which use
the javalite runtime). The runtime lives in
//third_party/android_deps/libs/com_google_protobuf_protobuf_javalite.

This package exists to decouple the protoc version that compiles java protos
from the protoc that compiles c++ protos since the runtimes are already
decoupled and the runtimes should be in lockstep with the compiler.

This package is not to be confused with //third_party/protobuf which contains
the protoc used to compile c++ protos and contains the c++ runtime.

Local Modifications:
None.
