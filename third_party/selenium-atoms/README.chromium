  atoms.h, atoms.cc
    These atoms are generated by the webdriver team and are to be checked in
    manually. The current version was generated from revision
    5d2650016de7f20ef2b86487820153b082d9528c.

    Generating the atoms require a build tool named Bazel. Download it
    from https://bazel.build/.

    To generate the atoms using the code found in selenium tree:
      $ git clone https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.git
      $ cd selenium
      $ git apply ${CHROMIUM_ROOT}/third_party/selenium-atoms/patch.diff
      $ bazel build javascript/chrome-driver/...
      $ cp bazel-bin/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.h \
           ${CHROMIUM_ROOT}/third_party/selenium-atoms/atoms.h
      $ cp bazel-bin/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.cc \
           ${CHROMIUM_ROOT}/third_party/selenium-atoms/atoms.cc

    The atoms.h/cc files are only used directly in the chrome version of
    webdriver found under the path //chrome/test/chromedriver.

    bazel-bin is a symlink. To find files within the selenium folder, add -L
    $ find -L . -name atoms.h

    If the patch.diff fails to apply, rerun with --reject. Review the output and
    manually merge the failed changes. Regenerate the patch when finished:
    $ git diff > ${CHROMIUM_ROOT}/third_party/selenium-atoms/patch.diff

Local Modifications:
- Applied changes in patch.diff to the selenium tree prior to building the atoms.
