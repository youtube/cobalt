// A set of utility functions to generate native events in platform
// independent way. Note that since the implementations depend on a window being
// top level, these can only be called from test suites that are not sharded.
// For aura tests, please look into |aura::test:EventGenerator| first. This
// class provides a way to emulate events in synchronous way and it is often
// easier to write tests with this class than using |ui_controls|.
//
// Many of the functions in this class include a variant that takes a Closure.
// The version that takes a Closure waits until the generated event is
// processed. Once the generated event is processed the Closure is Run (and
// deleted). Note that this is a somewhat fragile process in that any event of
// the correct type (key down, mouse click, etc.) will trigger the Closure to be
// run. Hence a usage such as
//
//   SendKeyPress(...);
//   SendKeyPressNotifyWhenDone(..., task);
//
// might trigger |task| early.
//
// Note: Windows does not currently do anything with the |window| argument for
// these functions, so passing NULL is ok.

// Per the above comment, these methods can only be called from non-sharded test
// suites. This method ensures that they're not accidently called by sharded
