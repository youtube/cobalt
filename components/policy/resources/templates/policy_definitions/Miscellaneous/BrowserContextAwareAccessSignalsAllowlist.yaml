caption: Enable the <ph name="CHROME_ENTERPRISE_DEVICE_TRUST_CONNECTOR">Chrome Enterprise Device Trust Connector</ph> attestation flow for a list of URLs on Managed Browsers
desc: |-
  Enable <ph name="CHROME_ENTERPRISE_DEVICE_TRUST_CONNECTOR">Chrome Enterprise Device Trust Connector</ph> for a list of URLs.

  Setting this policy specifies for which URLs <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will offer to start the attestation flow for managed browsers. The latter allows those websites to get an attested set of context-aware signals from the device.
  This policy can only be configured via the Chrome Enterprise Connectors page on the <ph name="GOOGLE_ADMIN_CONSOLE_PRODUCT_NAME">Google Admin console</ph>.

  Leaving this policy unset or empty means that no website will be able to start a browser-level attestation flow and get signals from the device. However if the corresponding
  <ph name="USER_CONTEXT_AWARE_ACCESS_SIGNALS_ALLOWLIST">UserContextAwareAccessSignalsAllowlist</ph> policy is enabled then the attestation flow can be started for the managed profile and device signals can be collected.

  For detailed information on valid <ph name="URL_LABEL">URL</ph> patterns, please see https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format.
