caption: Control the nesting threshold before which Javascript setTimeout() function
  start being clamped

desc: "setTimeout(…, 0) is commonly used to break down long Javascript tasks.\n  \
  \        When the policy is set to Enabled, setTimeouts and setIntervals with an\
  \ interval smaller than 4ms are not clamped as aggressively.\n          This improves\
  \ short horizon performance, but websites abusing the API will still eventually\
  \ have their setTimeouts clamped.\n\n          When the policy is set to Disabled,\
  \ setTimeouts and setIntervals with an interval smaller than 4ms will be clamped.\n\
  \n          This may change task ordering on a web page, leading to unexpected behavior\
  \ on sites that are dependent on a certain ordering in some way.\n          It also\
  \ may affect sites with a lot of setTimeout() with a timeout of 0ms usage, e.g.\
  \ increasing CPU load.\n\n          For users where this policy is unset, <ph name=\"\
  PRODUCT_NAME\">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will roll out the change gradually\
  \ on the stable channel.\n\n          This is a temporary policy that is planned\
  \ be removed in <ph name=\"PRODUCT_NAME\">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> 107. This\
  \ deadline may be extended if there is a need for it among enterprises.\n      \
