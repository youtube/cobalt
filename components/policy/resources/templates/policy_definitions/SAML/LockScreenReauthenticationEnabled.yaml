caption: Enables online re-authentication on lock screen for SAML users
desc: |-
  Enables online user signin on a lock screen. If the policy is set to true online re-authentication on the lock screen is triggered e.g. by <ph name="POLICY">SAMLOfflineSigninTimeLimit</ph>.
        The re-authentication is enforced immediately when on the lock screen or next time a user locks the screen after the condition is met.
        If the policy is set to false or unset users can always unlock the screen with their local credentials.
