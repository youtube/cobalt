//
// Before a Router can participate in any actual routing, it must have an
// outward link to another Router (see SetOutwardLink()). To establish a locally
// connected pair of Routers, pass both to LocalRouterLink::Create() and pass
// each returned link to the coresponding router:
//
//     Router::Pair routers = {MakeRefCounted<Router>(),

//     routers.second->SetOutwardLink(std::move(links.second));
//
// Each ipcz Portal directly controls a terminal Router along its route, and
// all routes stabilize to eventually consist of only two interconnected
// terminal Routers. When a portal moves, its side of the route is extended by
// creating a new terminal Router at the portal's new location. The previous
// terminal Router remains as a proxying hop to be phased out eventually.
