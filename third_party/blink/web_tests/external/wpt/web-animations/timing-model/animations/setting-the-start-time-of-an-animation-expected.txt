This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Validate different value types that can be used to set start time assert_throws_js: function "() => {
    animation.startTime = CSSNumericValue.parse("30%");
  }" threw object "NotSupportedError: Failed to set the 'startTime' property on 'Animation': Invalid startTime. CSSNumericValue must be either a number or a time value for time based animations."
