  If this policy is set, it specifies the length of time without user input (in minutes) before the browser runs actions configured via the <ph name="IDLE_TIMEOUT_ACTIONS_POLICY_NAME">IdleTimeoutActions</ph> policy.

  If this policy is not set, no action will be ran.

  The minimum threshold is 1 minute.

  "User input" is defined by Operating System APIs, and includes things like moving the mouse or typing on the keyboard.
