    A new version of &quot;Blink.Canvas.ToBlob.InitiateEncodingDelay&quot;

    This metric measures the time spent from initiating image encoding (jpeg or

    This metric is useful in helping us adjust the IdleTaskStartTimeoutDelay in

    IdleTaskStartTimeoutDelay, the browser will switch to a non-idle task to
    force initialization and encoding to occur on the main thread.

    Note: This metric drops reports on clients with low-resolution clocks, which

    A new version of &quot;Blink.Canvas.ToBlob.InitiateEncodingDelay&quot;

    This metric measures the total time spent on completing encoding all the

    Encoding occurs during one or more idle periods on the main thread and the
    waiting time of the next idle period is included in the measurement. If the
    code has swtiched to force encoding path, we will not measure the delay in
    this metric.

    This metric is useful in helping us adjust the IdleTaskCompleteTimeoutDelay

    This histogram records whether an image has been decoded by a single client
    or by multiple clients during decoding. For an image to be decoded, it is
    always requested by a client with a client_id. If an image has been
    requested by multiple clients, it would be decoded more than once. The
    histogram value is recorded at most two times per image (once per bucket).
    There will be overlap for two buckets, but we can get the the number of an
    image decodeded by only one client with the difference between two buckets.
    This helps us to know how often images get duplicated decoding in real life.

  <summary>
    Time taken to completely decode an image frame of the {Type} file format.
    This includes time spent in codec implementations but excludes time spent
    waiting for the network or file cache to deliver the source bytes.

    For incremental decoding, e.g. the source bytes involve multiple network
    events, only the final event (producing a complete image frame) triggers a
    histogram record, but that record holds the total time spent on that frame.

    Incomplete (partially decoded) image frames (e.g. navigating away from the
    web page before any of its images fully loaded) are not recorded here, but
    they still might be recorded in the separate Blink.DecodedImageType
    histogram if the partial decoding was able to determine width and height.

    An image's frames may be decoded more than once. If so, {Index}
    distinguishes whether every decode of every frame is tracked or just the
    first (not repeated) decode of the first (not later) frame.

    For an example of repeated (not first) decodes, when switching between tabs
    or scrolling a web page, a previously decoded frame may be discarded so that
    the backing memory can be re-used elsewhere. When that image comes back into
    view, its frame may need decoding again.

    For an example of later (not first) frames, animated images may produce
    multiple frames from a single img tag. Looping animations may be able to
    cache all of the decoded frames after the first playthrough but, if too big
    to cache, playing the loop continually may keep adding Every histogram
    records as uncached frames are repeatedly decoded.

    The Every {Index} correlates more with &quot;how much CPU time (which
    correlates with battery consumption) is spent overall in {Type}
    decoding&quot;. The First {Index} correlates more with &quot;how long until
    First Contentful Paint&quot;.

    Records usage of CSS properties used on a page, either statically or
    dynamically, from the time the page is initialised to when it is closed or
    navigated away from. Each property is counted at most once per page per view
    via PageLoadMetricsObserver.

    The first time a CSS property is parsed on a page, the histogram is updated
    to increment the counter. Each histogram bucket corresponds to a CSS
    property (eg. width, border-radius). The exception is the 'Total pages
    measured' bucket - this counts the number of pages that CSS properties were
    counted on. When a page navigation occurs the page count bucket is
    incremented and tracking of the set of which properties have been seen is
    reset.

    These numbers give the percentage of pages that use a CSS property. For
    example, if the 'border-radius' histogram bucket has a count of 250, and the
    page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) has a count of 1000 - this means
    that 1000 pages were recorded, and border-radius was used on 25% of those
    pages.

    Note that CSS properties used inside of SVG images are tracked separately in
    the Blink.UseCounter.SVGImage.CSSProperties histogram.

    Time spent executing a script task that draws content to a {Context} context

    Windows. See Windows.HasHighResolutionTimeTicks for the affected sample.
