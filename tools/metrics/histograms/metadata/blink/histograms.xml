    This metric measures the time spent from initiating image encoding (jpeg or

    This metric is useful in helping us adjust the IdleTaskStartTimeoutDelay in

    A new version of &quot;Blink.Canvas.ToBlob.InitiateEncodingDelay&quot;

    This metric measures the total time spent on completing encoding all the

    Encoding occurs during one or more idle periods on the main thread and the
    waiting time of the next idle period is included in the measurement. If the

    this metric.

    This metric is useful in helping us adjust the IdleTaskCompleteTimeoutDelay

  <summary>
    This histogram records whether an image has been decoded by a single client
    or by multiple clients during decoding. For an image to be decoded, it is
    always requested by a client with a client_id. If an image has been
    requested by multiple clients, it would be decoded more than once. The
    histogram value is recorded at most two times per image (once per bucket).
    There will be overlap for two buckets, but we can get the the number of an
    image decodeded by only one client with the difference between two buckets.
    This helps us to know how often images get duplicated decoding in real life.

    Number of pixels in a decoded JPEG image. Recorded after decoding is done by
    Blink's JPEG decoder (as opposed to, possibly, a hardware decode
    accelerator). Tracking the image area may include degenerate cases, e.g., an
    image with area = 10000 and dimensions = 1x10000. However, it is reasonable
    to assume these cases are relatively rare and the area of the image can
    serve as a proxy of how useful a decode accelerator can be (the larger the

    Time spent computing IntersectionObserver observations in the Blink document
    lifecycle where the observation is for a media element. Recorded when an
    intersection observation is made attributed to a media element (such as
    video auto-play).

    Note: PreFCP metrics will be recorded even if FCP is not reached, whereas
    AggregatedPreFCP metrics are only recorded if FCP is reached.

    Note: Not recorded on ~5% of Windows machines with low-resolution clocks.

    Records usage of CSS properties used on a page, either statically or

    navigated away from. Each property is counted at most once per page per view
    via PageLoadMetricsObserver.

    The first time a CSS property is parsed on a page, the histogram is updated
    to increment the counter. Each histogram bucket corresponds to a CSS
    property (eg. width, border-radius). The exception is the 'Total pages
    measured' bucket - this counts the number of pages that CSS properties were
    counted on. When a page navigation occurs the page count bucket is
    incremented and tracking of the set of which properties have been seen is
    reset.

    These numbers give the percentage of pages that use a CSS property. For
    example, if the 'border-radius' histogram bucket has a count of 250, and the
    page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) has a count of 1000 - this means
    that 1000 pages were recorded, and border-radius was used on 25% of those
    pages.

    Note that CSS properties used inside of SVG images are tracked separately in

    Time spent waiting for the compositor thread to begin processing a layer
    update inside ProxyMain::BeginMainFrame.

    Note: PreFCP metrics will be recorded even if FCP is not reached, whereas
    AggregatedPreFCP metrics are only recorded if FCP is reached.

    Note: Not recorded on ~5% of Windows machines with low-resolution clocks.

    Note: The histograms with PreFCP/PostFCP/AggregatedPreFCP suffixes before
    105.0.5175.0 were impacted by https://crbug.com/1330675. Be careful when
    aggregating or comparing these histograms across the version.
