Description:
JsonCpp is used by multiple projects for parsing and generating JSON data. This
project is mirrored here from the public GitHub project, with a custom BUILD.gn
to allow for building with our Ninja + GN configuration. The main project uses
Meson or CMake for building.

This is for other third party modules (not including third_party/blink) only.
Don't use JsonCpp from chromium or blink code, but use base/values.h, base/json,
and third_party/blink/platform/json (for blink) instead.
