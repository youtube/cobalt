    A button with aria-pressed becomes a toggle button, but that does not work
    on native buttons. Anyway, we want to test the consistency of the name
    calculation here: it should get the same name as from:
      <button id="test">
      <div id="test" role="button" aria-pressed="false">
  -->
  <button id="test" aria-pressed="false">
    <div aria-hidden="true">13</div>
    <span class="sr-only">13 December</span>
  </button>
</body>
