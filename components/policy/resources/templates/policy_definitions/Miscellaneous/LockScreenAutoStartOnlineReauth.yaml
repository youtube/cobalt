caption: Automatic start of online re-authentication on the lock screen
default: false
desc: |-
  On the lock screen users have an option to open an online re-authentication
  window and use it for authentication process to re-enter their session. This
  policy can be used to automatically open the window if online
  re-authentication is required.

  If the policy is set to Enabled and online re-authentication is required, the
  online re-authentication window is opened automatically.

  If the policy is set to Disabled or unset, the online re-authentication window
  has to be opened manually.

  Online re-authentication can become required for a number of reasons, such as
  password change, but it can be also enforced by certain policies such as

  <ph name="SAML_LOCK_SCREEN_OFFLINE_SIGNIN_TIME_LIMIT_DAYS_POLICY_NAME">SamlLockScreenOfflineSigninTimeLimitDays</ph>.
