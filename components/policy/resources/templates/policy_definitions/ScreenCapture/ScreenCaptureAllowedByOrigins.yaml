caption: Allow Desktop, Window, and Tab capture by these origins
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets you set a list of URL patterns that can use Desktop, Window, and Tab Capture.

        Leaving the policy unset means that sites will not be considered for an override at this level of Capture.

        This policy is not considered if a site matches a URL pattern in any of the following policies: <ph name="WINDOW_CAPTURE_ALLOWED_BY_ORIGINS_POLICY_NAME">WindowCaptureAllowedByOrigins</ph>, <ph name="TAB_CAPTURE_ALLOWED_BY_ORIGINS_POLICY_NAME">TabCaptureAllowedByOrigins</ph>, <ph name="SAME_ORIGIN_TAB_CAPTURE_ALLOWED_BY_ORIGINS_POLICY_NAME">SameOriginTabCaptureAllowedByOrigins</ph>.

        If a site matches a URL pattern in this policy, the <ph name="SCREEN_CAPTURE_ALLOWED_POLICY_NAME">ScreenCaptureAllowed</ph> will not be considered.

        For detailed information on valid <ph name="URL_LABEL">url</ph> patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.  This policy only matches based on origin, so any path in the URL pattern is ignored.
