caption: Enable face control on the login screen
default: null
desc: |-
  When face control is active, you can use your head to control the mouse cursor and use
  facial gestures to perform system actions. This allows you to control your device
  hands-free.

  If this policy is set to true, face control will always be enabled on the login screen.

  If this policy is set to false, face control will always be disabled on the login screen.

  If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

  If this policy is left unset, face control is disabled on the login screen initially but can be enabled by the user anytime.
