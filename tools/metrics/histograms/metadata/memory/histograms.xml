  <summary>
    This metric is only recorded on iOS. This measures the sum of
    PrivateMemoryFootprint and SharedMemoryFootprint, which is possible because
    Chromium on iOS is single-process. Note that this does not include memory
    consumed by WebKit-launched processes, such as the WebContent and Network
    processes.

    Emitted when closing a log in order to upload it. This happens shortly after
    startup and again at regular intervals (usually 5 minutes, regardless of the
    type of network connection). Not emitted in logs that are closed when Chrome
    loses focus or closes. Yet, it is emitted on logs that are constructed from
    data persisted from a previous session, i.e., persisted from an unclean
    shutdown.

    Many changes in memory usage on iOS come from changes to WebKit, rather than
    changes within Chromium code. To assess whether a change in this metric is
    caused by a WebKit change, split by OS version. WebKit changes always come
    with an OS version change.

    As with other memory metrics, memory use tends to increase over time.
    Restarts due to OS or Chrome updates tend to make this metric drop.

    This histogram is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

    This metric is only recorded on iOS when
    UIApplication.sharedApplication.applicationState is
    UIApplicationStateActive. True if the sum of PrivateMemoryFootprint and
    SharedMemoryFootprint is greater than 200MB. According to Apple, apps on
    iPhone 6 and older devices get terminated by the OS if memory usage crosses
    200MB watermark, so it's important to keep the memory usage under 200MB.

    Investigation into crbug.com/1102494 shows that OverscrollActionsController
    is allocating thousands of objects in it's -initWithScrollView:. This is
    likely because thousands of OverscrollActionsControllers are being
    initialized. The theory is that there are users that have many many tabs,
    causing many OverscrollActionsControllers to be allocated. This histogram
    tests that theory by logging how many open tabs there are. This is recorded

  <summary>
    A rough estimate of the private memory footprint of the browser process.

    Recorded at Poisson sampled time intervals with a mean of 5 minutes on
    Android and 30 minutes on other platforms.

    This memory footprint metric cannot be compared across platforms because
    each platform relies on platform-level APIs for accounting. As such, though
    this attempts to measure private memory footprint as best as possible, it
    does not measure the same thing on each platform. We have not found a good
    way to compare any system level memory metric across platforms due to the
    different nature of memory management on each platform.

  <summary>
    The number of glyph pages present in the renderer when it commits a load.
    Since this is per-sub-process, you can get the average number of glyph pages
    in the system by multiplying this number with the average number of
    renderers. Note that this typically won't count the glyph pages added as a
    result of the load that just committed, since layout will happen after the
    commit. There are 512 bytes per glyph page, but this number also very
    closely approximates the number of glyph width map pages in the same
    renderer. The only difference is that if you have font fallback, it will
    make a new glyph page and no width page, but in most common cases there is
    no fallback). Width pages are 1K each (256 floats), so you could think of
    this value as being the number of &quot;1.5K units related to glyphs per
    renderer per page load&quot;.

    metric will drastically underestimate the true cost of rendering. On devices
    with unified memory (most Android, laptop and desktop clients with
    integrated graphics, and all ARM64 mac clients), graphics buffers come from
    the same memory pool as system RAM. For more details, alternative metrics to

    each platform relies on platform-level APIs for accounting. As such, though
    this attempts to measure private memory footprint as best as possible, it
    does not measure the same thing on each platform. We have not found a good
    way to compare any system level memory metric across platforms due to the
    different nature of memory management on each platform.

    The percentage of the total renderer process count that is due to
    origin-keyed processes, based on the overhead estimate from
    Memory.RenderProcessHost.Count.OriginAgentClusterProcesses. That value is
    computed assuming no coalescing of multiple BrowsingInstances into a single
    RenderProcess (including no subframe process reuse), and only when
    cross-process origin isolation occurs due to origin-keying. Given this, the
    percentage of total SiteInstances due to origin-keying corresponds exactly
    to the percentage of RenderProcesses that origin-keying gives rise to.
    Recorded once per UMA ping.

    Note: when the feature OriginKeyedProcessesByDefault is enabled, all
    navigations are treated as if the OAC opt-in header is present, unless the
    OAC opt-out header is present. As a result, any analyses of this metric
    should separate users with and without OriginKeyedProcessesByDefault, to
