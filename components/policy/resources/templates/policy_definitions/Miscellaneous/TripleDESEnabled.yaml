desc: "This policy was removed in M97 after 3DES was removed from <ph name=\"PRODUCT_NAME\"\
  >$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.\n\n      If the policy is set to true, then 3DES\
  \ cipher suites in TLS will be enabled. If it is set to false, they will be disabled.\
  \ If the policy is unset, 3DES cipher suites are disabled by default. This policy\
  \ may be used to temporarily retain compatibility with an outdated server. This\
  \ is a stopgap measure and the server should be reconfigured.\n      "
