  <summary>
    Various status codes on reading persistence file from disk, in the search
    handler used by the ChromeOS launcher. Emitted once when a read happens to
    the persistence file, and this happens once per login. Some number of file
    not exist values is expected, because the persistence file does not exist
    before it is written for the first time.

  <summary>
    Various status codes on writing persistence file back to disk, in the search
    handler used by the ChromeOS launcher. Emitted once when a write happens to
    the persistence file, and this happens once per new web contents arrives,
    which is expected to be approx. once per login.

  <summary>
    The latency of the help search availability after the help app search
    handler constructed. Recorded each time a help app search handler is
    constructed.

  <summary>
    The end result of a search using the help app search handler. Logged once
    per time a search finishes. Not logged if the search is canceled by a new
    search starting. Use this to calculate the proportion of searches where the
    search handler is ready vs not ready. &quot;Ready&quot; means the update
    finished and the search handler is ready to handle searches.
