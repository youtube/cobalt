This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] dequantizeLinear uint8 1D constant tensor with implicit block_size = 2.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': DequantizeLinear can't support block-wise."
[FAIL] dequantizeLinear int8 4D constant tensor with block_size = [3, 2]
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': DequantizeLinear can't support block-wise."
[FAIL] dequantizeLinear uint4 1D tensor with even input size
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'cast' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint4 for output, must be one of [float32, float16, int32, uint32, int64, int8, uint8]."
[FAIL] dequantizeLinear uint4 1D tensor with odd input size
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'cast' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint4 for output, must be one of [float32, float16, int32, uint32, int64, int8, uint8]."
