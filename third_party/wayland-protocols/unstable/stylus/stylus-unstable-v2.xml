  <interface name="zcr_stylus_v2" version="2">
    <description summary="extends wl_touch and wl_pointer for styli">
      Allows a wl_touch or a wl_pointer to report stylus specific information.
      The client can use this protocol to obtain detail information about the
      type of stylus, as well as the force and tilt of the tool.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding uinterface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and uinterface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

      The zcr_pointer_stylus_v2 interface extends the wl_pointer interface with
      events to describe details about a stylus. A stylus that reports events
      through this interface also moves the mouse cursor. The type of the

      tool_type. When the tool changes, the values previously reported through
      this interface are assumed to be reset.

      These events are to be fired by the server within the same frame as other
      wl_pointer events.
