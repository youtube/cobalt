caption: Floating SSO Service domain blocklist exception list
desc: |-
  Configures the list of blocklist excepted cookie domains to be moved when a user switches between <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> devices, when the Floating SSO Service is enabled.

  If a cookie is set for a domain which matches one of the provided filters, the cookie is included into the move. Cookie domains are matched according to "host" field rules outlined in https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format, all other fields are ignored. Wildcards, <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph>, are allowed.

  Leaving the policy empty allows no exceptions to <ph name="FLOATING_SSO_DOMAIN_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">FloatingSsoDomainBlocklist</ph>. To only allow a limited number of domains to be moved, block all domains by setting the <ph name="FLOATING_SSO_DOMAIN_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">FloatingSsoDomainBlocklist</ph> policy to <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph>, and configure the blocklist exceptions here.
