  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the action type of the request. Recorded when a topics request is
    handled in `BrowsingTopicsService`. Redirects (for fetch and xhr) will be
    counted as separate histogram entries.

  <summary>
    Records the load finish status of BrowsingTopicsState. Recored when the
    state is loaded from the file at the start of each browser session.
  </summary>
</histogram>

  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the count of distinct history hosts that are eligible for topics
    calculation. Recorded during each (weekly) topics calculation after the
    observation domains are derived. In case of a calculation failure (e.g.
    permission denied, etc.), this metric won't be recorded.

  <summary>
    Records the count of topics derived from history hosts in the past epoch
    (week). Recorded during each (weekly) topics calculation after the top
    topics are derived. In case of a calculation failure (e.g. permission
    denied, etc.), this metric won't be recorded.

    This won't exceed the cap number
    `kBrowsingTopicsMaxNumberOfApiUsageContextDomainsToKeepPerTopic`. Recorded
    once for each calculated top topics, during each (weekly) topics calculation
    after the observation domains are derived. In case of a calculation failure
    (e.g. permission denied; candidate topic was blocked; etc.), this metric
    won't be recorded.

  <owner>yaoxia@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jkarlin@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the time between top topic calculations. Recorded when a topic
    calculation finishes and results from a prior epoch are available. This
    metric is recorded even in case of a calculation failure (e.g. permission
    denied, etc.).

    Records the count of derived top topics before random ones are padded.
    Recorded during each (weekly) topics calculation after the top topics are
    derived. In case of a calculation failure (e.g. permission denied, etc.),
    this metric won't be recorded.
