caption: Limit the time for which a user authenticated via GAIA without SAML can log
  in offline
default: null
desc: |-
  During login, <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> can authenticate against a server (online) or using a cached password (offline).

        When this policy is set to a value of -1, this policy will not enforce online authentication and will allow the user to use offline authentication until a different reason than this policy enforces an online login. If the policy is set to a value of 0, online login will always be required. When this policy is set to any other value, it specifies the length of time since the last online authentication after which the user must use online authentication again in the next sign-in.

        Leaving this policy not set will make <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> use offline login.

        This policy affects only users who authenticated using GAIA without SAML.

        The policy value should be specified in days.
