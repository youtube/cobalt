This directory contains a test suite for the proposed Web Locks API.

Explainer: https://github.com/inexorabletash/web-locks

Spec: https://inexorabletash.github.io/web-locks/

Most tests are upstreamed to web-platform-tests (external/wpt/web-locks);
tests that remain here depend on Chromium facilities (e.g. GC observation).
