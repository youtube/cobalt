This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Calling send() when data channel is in connecting state should throw InvalidStateError
PASS Datachannel should be able to send simple string and receive as string
PASS Datachannel should be able to send unicode string and receive as unicode string
PASS Datachannel should ignore binaryType and always receive string message as string
PASS Datachannel should be able to send an empty string and receive an empty string
PASS Datachannel should be able to send Uint8Array message and receive as ArrayBuffer
PASS Datachannel should be able to send ArrayBuffer message and receive as ArrayBuffer
PASS Datachannel should be able to send an empty ArrayBuffer message and receive as ArrayBuffer
FAIL Datachannel should be able to send Blob message and receive as ArrayBuffer promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
FAIL Datachannel should be able to send ArrayBuffer message and receive as Blob promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to set the 'binaryType' property on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
FAIL Datachannel binaryType should receive message as Blob by default assert_equals: Expect initial binaryType value to be blob expected "blob" but got "arraybuffer"
FAIL Datachannel sending multiple messages with different types should succeed and be received assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet Reached unreachable code

Harness: the test ran to completion.
