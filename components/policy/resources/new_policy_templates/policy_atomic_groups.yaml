# Policies from an atomic group need to have their values coming from the same
# source. If policies from an atomic group come from multiple sources, only the
# policies coming from the same source will be applied. The source with the
# higher priority will be the one from which policies are applied.
# i.e. Policy1 and Policy2 come from GPO and Policy3 comes from the cloud.
# If GPO has priority over the cloud, only Policy1 and Policy2 will be applied.
# For this to take effect, PolicyAtomicGroupsEnabled must he set to true.
