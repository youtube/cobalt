# Starboard Versioning

## Motivation

When a porter implements Starboard for a platform, it is more precise to say
that they have implemented support for a certain version of Starboard.
Changes to the Starboard API are associated with Starboard versions. Any usage
of new Starboard APIs must also be protected by a compile-time check for the
Starboard version it belongs to. This decoupling of Cobalt and Starboard
versions ensures that a porter can update to a newer version of Cobalt, but not
be required to implement new Starboard APIs, if the version of Starboard they
have implemented is still supported.

## Starboard API version vs. Starboard application version

The Starboard version describes the set of Starboard APIs available to Starboard
applications. It will be incremented with every open-source release that
includes changes to the Starboard API. Reasons to increment the Starboard API
version include:

* New Starboard APIs
* Removed Starboard APIs
* Modified semantics to existing APIs

Some notable cases that do not justify incrementing the Starboard version
include:

* More descriptive or clearer comments for existing APIs that do not change the
  semantics
* New utility classes that are built on top of Starboard APIs, such as
  `starboard::ScopedFile`
* Changes that affect the upward API to Starboard applications, but not the
  downward API to porters. For example, defining new upward APIs in terms of
  existing Starboard APIs.

A particular Starboard application may be versioned independently of the
Starboard API. A given version of a Starboard application may support a range of
Starboard versions. It may be the case that some new functionality in a
Starboard application requires Starboard APIs that were added to a particular
API version. If a porter wants to use such a feature, they must therefore also
implement the required version of the Starboard API. For example, Voice Search
was added to Cobalt version 5 and requires the SbMicrophone APIs which were
added to Starboard version 2. Platforms that implemented Starboard version 1
continued to build and run Cobalt 5 correctly, but the Voice Search feature
would be unavailable.

## Range of supported Starboard versions

The minimum supported API version is defined by the `SB_MINIMUM_API_VERSION`
macro, which is defined in starboard/configuration.h. Likewise, the
`SB_MAXIMUM_API_VERSION` macro defines the maximum supported API version. All
platforms must declare a `SB_API_VERSION` macro in the platform’s
configuration.h to declare the starboard version the platform has implemented.
Declaring implementation for an API version outside this range will result in an
error at compilation time.
Generally Starboard applications will not support all versions of the Starboard
API indefinitely. Starboard application owners may increment the minimum
required Starboard version at their discretion.
TBD: Timelines and communication around when an upcoming Cobalt release will
require porters to implement a newer version of Starboard.

## Using new Starboard APIs from Starboard Applications

Usage of a Starboard API that is not available in all supported Starboard API
versions must be guarded with a check for `SB_API_VERSION`. Starboard
applications must continue to function correctly and must not disable existing
functionality if this check evaluates to false, but it’s acceptable to disable
new functionality in Starboard applications if this evaluates to false.

## Adding and using new Starboard APIs

### The "Experimental" Starboard Version

At any given time, exactly one version of Starboard will be denoted as the
"experimental" version, as defined by the `SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION` macro in
`starboard/configuration.h`. It is generally not recommended to declare support
for this version. Any Starboard APIs defined in the experimental version are
subject to change and API requirements could be added, removed, or changed at
any time.

### The "Release Candidate" Starboard Version

At any given time, zero or more versions of Starboard will be denoted as the
"release candidate" version, as defined by the
`SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION` macro in `starboard/configuration.h`. The
"release candidate" version is a set of API changes that have been considered
and tested together. It is reasonable to port against this version, it has gone
through some stabilization and may become frozen as it currently is. But, be
aware that it is possible that minor incompatible changes may be made to this
version if an unexpected situation arises. `SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION` is
not defined if there is no "release candidate" version. Every API version
greater than `SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION` but less than `SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION` is also considered a release candidate.

### "Frozen" Starboard versions

All Starboard versions that are less than the experimental and release candidate
versions are considered frozen. Any Starboard APIs in a frozen version MUST not
change.

### Version Numbers, and how They Interrelate Numerically

```
frozen < release-candidate < experimental < future
```

As mentioned previously, a release candidate version may or may not exist at any
given time.  When there is a release candate version, it follows the invariant
above.

### Life of a Starboard API

New Starboard APIs should be defined in the experimental version.

When introducing a new Starboard API (or modifying an existing one), a new
feature version define should be created within the "Experimental Feature
Defines" section of `starboard/configuration.h`, and set to
`SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION`. A well written comment should be added in front
of the feature define that describes exactly what is introduced by the feature.
In the comment, all new/modified/removed symbols should be identified, and all
modified header files should be named.

For example,

```
// in starboard/configuration.h

#define SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION 7

#undef SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION

// --- Experimental Feature Defines ------------------------------------------

...

// Introduce a new API in starboard/screensaver.h, which declares the following
// functions for managing the platform's screensaver settings:
//   SbScreensaverDisableScreensaver()
//   SbScreensaverEnableScreensaver()
// Additionally, a new event, kSbEventTypeScreensaverStarted, is introduced in
// starboard/event.h.
#define SB_SCREENSAVER_FEATURE_API_VERSION SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION

// Introduce a new API in starboard/new_functionality.h which declares the
// function SbNewFunctionality().
#define SB_MY_NEW_FEATURE_API_VERSION SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION

// Introduce another new API in starboard/still_in_development.h which
// declares the function SbStillInDevelopment().
#define SB_MY_OTHER_NEW_FEATURE_API_VERSION SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION
```

When declaring the new interface, the following syntax should be used:

```
// starboard/new_functionality.h
#if SB_API_VERSION >= SB_MY_NEW_FEATURE_API_VERSION
void SbNewFunctionality();
#endif
```

Starboard application features that use a new API must have a similar check:

```
// cobalt/new_feature.cc
#if SB_API_VERSION >= SB_MY_NEW_FEATURE_API_VERSION
void DoSomethingCool() {
  SbNewFunctionality();
}
#endif
```

When promoting the experimental API version to be the release candidate API
version, the previously undefined `SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION` is set to
the current value of `SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION`, and
`SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION` is then incremented by one. As a result,
`SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION` on the master branch should always either be
undefined, or `SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION - 1`.

One or more features are then moved from `SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION` to
`SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION`, and into the "Release Candidate Feature
Defines" section of `starboard/configuration.h`. Some features may be left in
experimental if they are not ready for release. The documentation comments of
these features should be moved into the (newly created) section for the
corresponding version in [starboard/CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

```
// in starboard/configuration.h

#define SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION 8

#define SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION 7

// --- Experimental Feature Defines ------------------------------------------

// Introduce another new API in starboard/still_in_development.h which
// declares the function SbStillInDevelopment().
#define SB_MY_OTHER_NEW_FEATURE_API_VERSION SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION

// --- Release Candidate Features Defines ------------------------------------

#define SB_MY_NEW_FEATURE_API_VERSION SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION

```

When a release candidate branch is promoted to a full release, these new
Starboard APIs will be irrevocably frozen to the value of
`SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION`, and the release candidate version will be
undefined. Additionally, the feature defines should be removed.

```
// starboard/new_functionality.h
#if SB_API_VERSION >= 7
void SbNewFunctionality();
#endif

// starboard/other_new_functionality.h
#if SB_API_VERSION >= SB_MY_OTHER_NEW_FEATURE_API_VERSION
void SbStillInDevelopment();
#endif

// starboard/configuration.h
#define SB_EXPERIMENTAL_API_VERSION 8
#undef SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION

// cobalt/new_feature.cc
#if SB_API_VERSION >= 7
void DoSomethingCool() {
  SbNewFunctionality();
}
#endif
```

Whoever increments the experimental version must ensure that stubs and reference
platforms declare support for the new experimental version through their
respective `SB_API_VERSION` macros.

### Communicating Starboard API changes to porters

When a new version of Starboard is released, [starboard/CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) should be
updated with the feature define comments for all features enabled in that
version.
