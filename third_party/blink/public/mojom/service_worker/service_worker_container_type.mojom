// ServiceWorkerContainer is the spec concept that is exposed to a service
// worker client or a service worker itself, and ServiceWorkerContainerHost is
// the host of the container.
// https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#serviceworkercontainer-interface
//
// This enum identifies which context ServiceWorkerContainer(Host) works for.
// Currently, only windows support web-exposed ServiceWorkerContainer
// (see https://crbug.com/371690), but ServiceWorkerContainerHost is created for
// them all to provide service worker functionalities. Therefore, this enum also
// defines the types for workers that don't support ServiceWorkerContainer yet.
// See header comments on ServiceWorkerContainerHost for details.

  kUnknown,

  // For service worker clients.
