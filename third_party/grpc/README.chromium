Steps to upgrade to a new version of GRPC, all relative to //third_party/grpc:
1. Update ../../DEPS to pull origin/grpc/master.
   NOTE: Tagged "official releases" do not work on the buildbots. The master
   branch must be used.
2. Update revision and version information in this file. Version file can be
   found in the root BUILD.gn file in gRPC repo.
3. Checkout GRPC submodules by running from the src/ directory:
   git submodule update --init
4. Copy template/BUILD.chromium.gn.template to src/templates.
5. Rebuild BUILD.gn by running from the src/ directory:
   tools/buildgen/generate_projects.sh
    (make sure mako_templates python module is installed in your system using
     command "apt-get install python3-mako")
   This will use the template in templates/BUILD.chromium.gn.template to
   generate src/BUILD.chromium.gn file.
6. Run: mv third_party/grpc/src/BUILD.chromium.gn third_party/grpc/BUILD.gn
7. Run: gn format --in-place BUILD.gn

We have a helper script `generate_gn.sh` does step (4), (5), (6), and (7).

Note: Please also remember to check if `plugin_registry/grpc_plugin_registry.cc`
needs update! Upstream sometimes introduces new plugins in 
`/src/src/core/plugin_registry/grpc_plugin_registry.cc` and we may need to update
our custom `grpc_plugin_registry.cc`.
