Overview

    This extension provides a query mechanism that allows the client to get
    timing information from the Chromium command buffer.

    GL_COMMANDS_ISSUED_CHROMIUM can be used to measure the time elapsed in
    microseconds between a BeginQueryEXT and an EndQueryEXT. This is the time
    that it takes to issue the enclosed commands to the underlying driver (not
    the time it takes to complete them). It only counts time during which the
    associated context is scheduled. The value of the timer can be obtained
    using GetQueryObjectuivEXT.

New Procedures and Functions

    void BeginQueryEXT(enum target, uint id);
    void EndQueryEXT(enum target);
    void QueryCounterEXT(uint id, enum target);
    void GetQueryivEXT(enum target, enum pname, int *params);
    void GetQueryObjectuivEXT(uint id, enum pname, uint *params);
    void GetQueryObjectui64vEXT(uint id, enum pname, uint64 *params);

Errors

    None.

New Tokens

    and GetQueryivEXT:

    Accepted by the <target> parameter of QueryCounterEXT and GetQueryivEXT:

        GL_COMMANDS_ISSUED_TIMESTAMP_CHROMIUM           0x6005

New State
