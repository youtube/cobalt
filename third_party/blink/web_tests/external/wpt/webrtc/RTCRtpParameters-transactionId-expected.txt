This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] sender.getParameters() should return the same transaction ID if called back-to-back without relinquishing the event loop, even if the microtask queue runs
  assert_true: expected true got false
[FAIL] sender.getParameters() should return the same transaction ID if called back-to-back without relinquishing the event loop, even if there is an intervening call to setParameters
  assert_true: expected true got false
[FAIL] setParameters() when the event loop has been relinquished since the last getParameters() should reject with InvalidStateError
  assert_unreached: Should have rejected: undefined Reached unreachable code
Harness: the test ran to completion.
