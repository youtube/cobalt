// This method expects the caller to pass in the ring buffer's floatBuffer as
// opposed to getting the float buffer using [self.ringBuffer floatBuffer]
// within the implementation in order to avoid performing an extra memcpy.
// TFLFloatBuffer free's its float *data when it deallocates. Accessing
// [self.ringBuffer floatBuffer] inside this method will cause the returned
// float* to be deallocated when this method call completes and hence will
// warrant a copy of the float * to the cAudioBuffer. Instead the classify() of
// TFLAudioClassifier calls [audioTensor floatBuffer] and passes it into this
// method which will prevent the float* from being deallocated until classify()
// method completes.
