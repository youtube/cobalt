[PASS] Partial interface Keyboard: original interface defined
[PASS] Partial interface Keyboard: member names are unique
[PASS] KeyboardLayoutMap interface: existence and properties of interface object
[PASS] KeyboardLayoutMap interface object length
[PASS] KeyboardLayoutMap interface object name
[PASS] KeyboardLayoutMap interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
[PASS] KeyboardLayoutMap interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
[PASS] KeyboardLayoutMap interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
[PASS] KeyboardLayoutMap interface: maplike<DOMString, DOMString>
[PASS] KeyboardLayoutMap must be primary interface of layout_map
[PASS] Stringification of layout_map
[PASS] Keyboard interface: operation getLayoutMap()
[FAIL] Keyboard interface: attribute onlayoutchange
  assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "onlayoutchange" expected true got false
[PASS] Keyboard interface: navigator.keyboard must inherit property "getLayoutMap()" with the proper type
[FAIL] Keyboard interface: navigator.keyboard must inherit property "onlayoutchange" with the proper type
