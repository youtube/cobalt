# This file is used as input to generate the following policy templates:
# ADM, ADMX+ADML, MCX/plist and html documentation.

# Policy templates are user interface definitions or documents about the
# policies that can be used to configure Chrome. Each policy is a name-value
# pair where the value has a given type. Chrome looks up the values using the
# names of the policies. In the user interface where the values can be set,
# related policies might appear together in policy groups. The grouping is not
# visible to Chrome.

# As a reference for translators, non-translatable strings must be tagged using
# <ph name="..."></ph> as described in [1]. As these tags are pruned before
# generating the comments for .proto files, paragraphs containing such tags
# should not be line-wrapped (use one long line per paragraph instead) to allow
# for correct re-flowing of the text.

# See documentation in docs/enterprise/description_guidelines.md for how product
# names should appear in <ph> tags to ensure consistency.
#
#
# Generated grd names:
#   Each name has two parts: the second part is either CAPTION, DESC or LABEL,
#   and the first part identifies the item the text applies to:
#   -For policies and groups:
#     IDS_POLICY_<NAME OF THE POLICY OR GROUP>
#     e.g. the name of the caption of policy HomepageLocation:
#       IDS_POLICY_HOMEPAGELOCATION_CAPTION
#     or other messages of the policy HomepageLocation:
#       IDS_POLICY_HOMEPAGELOCATION_LABEL
#       IDS_POLICY_HOMEPAGELOCATION_DESC
#   -For enum items:
#     IDS_POLICY_ENUM_<NAME OF THE ITEM>
#     e.g. the name of the caption of ProxyServerDisabled:
#       IDS_POLICY_ENUM_PROXYSERVERDISABLED_CAPTION

# This field is a list of strings which describe the group of people responsible
# for maintaining the policy and can help answer questions or solve issues with
# the policy. The entries can be either emails of committers or file://
# references to OWNERS files in the Chromium repository.
# There should be at least 2 owners per policies. At least one entry must be an
# email of the individual person or the team responsible for the policy.
# Additionally a file:// reference to an OWNERS file can also be specified.
owners:
- your-ldap@chromium.org
- file://components/policy/OWNERS

# Optional field that defaults to `caption` if not set.
# A short, one-line summary of the item it applies to. The difference from
# caption is that label always appears next to the entry field where the value
# of the policy can be entered. 'main' policies on Windows ignore this. Policies
# on Mac are using this instead of caption.
# Note: This should not end with a punctuation mark.
label: A short one line summary that may
  wrap to the next line

# A short, one-line summary of the item it applies to. This can appear
# both in policy or group listings or on title bars of policy-setting
# windows.
# Note: This should not end with a punctuation mark.
caption: A short one line summary that may
  wrap to the next line

#     $2 -> Google ChromeOS / ChromiumOS
#     $3 -> Google Chrome Frame / Chromium Frame
#     $6 is reserved for doc_writer

  # A metapolicy is a policy which affects how other policies are applied.
  # Precedence metapolicies affect how policies are prioritized depending on

  # metapolicy. The supported types are 'merge' (example policy is
  # PolicyListMultipleSourceMergeList) and 'precedence' (example policy is
  # CloudPolicyOverridesPlatformPolicy).
  metapolicy_type: ''

# Policy types:
#   string: a string value
#   int: an integer value
#   int-enum: the user can select an integer value from a collection of items
#   string-enum: the user can select a string value from a collection of items
#   string-enum-list: the user can select a set of string values from a
#                     collection of items
#   main: a boolean value
#   list: a list of string values. Using this for a list of JSON strings is now
#         discouraged, because the dict is better for JSON.
#   dict: perhaps should be named JSON. An arbitrarily complex object or array,
#         nested objects/arrays, etc. The user defines the value with JSON.
#   external: a policy that references external data. (Supported on ChromeOS only).
type: main

# This schema supports a subset of the JSON Schema standard
# (https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/index.html). For more
# information see //components/policy/tools/schema_validator.py. This
# validator is also used during presubmit to validate all schemas,
# validation_schemas and the example_values. On the client-side we use
# //components/policy/core/common/schema.h to validate policy values against
# the provided schemas in this file. This validator supports the same subset
# of features supported by the python schema validator used during presubmit.

# For many policies this is simply a type eg 'boolean' or 'string', but for
# 'dict' policies this describes the types of not only the root object, but
# also all of its descendants. This schema data is used to validate 'dict'
# policies, if a SchemaValidatingPolicyHandler is configured appropriately in
# configuration_policy_handler_list_factory.cc

# Some policies at first seem to have simple schema e.g. a string or a list of
# strings, but those strings are actually JSON strings, and this JSON has
# another schema. This type of policy is deprecated. When adding new policies,
# make sure the entire schema is described by the 'schema' field and that
# there are no strings which contain JSON.
# The legacy policies which contain JSON strings have an extra field, the
# 'validation_schema' which is used to validate not only the schema of the
# policy itself, but also the content of the JSON strings inside the policy.
# Do not use this field when adding new policies.

# In order to hide sensitive policy values from the user, you can use
# 'sensitiveValue': True (default 'False') in the associated schema. Those
# values will be masked with '********' in the chrome://policy UI and policy
# exports. 'sensitiveValue' can be applied to all schema types.

# For some policies which have complicated schema we add either
# 'description_schema' which describes some but not necessarily all properties
# of the policy or 'url_schema' which contains the link to the expanded
# documentation.
# Note that 'description_schema' is used for documentation purposes only, but
# not for schema validation. It can be used in cases where validation is not
# desired, e.g. if the schema does not describe all properties (see
# ArcPolicy).

# Used to outline the behavior of each state the policy can take.
# This field is only used for policies of type 'main', 'int-enum', or
# 'string-enum'. For 'main' policies, it describes how the policy behaves when

# enabled/disabled states. For 'enum' policies, it lists all possible values
# the policy can be set to along with a brief description.

# controlled by the policy behaves as if the policy was set to `true`.
# If the default value cannot be expressed with the given type and is equivalent
# to unset, it should be represent with `null`.
