CONSOLE WARNING: Listener added for a synchronous 'DOMSubtreeModified' DOM Mutation Event. This event type is deprecated (https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#legacy-event-types) and work is underway to remove it from this browser. Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a risk of future incompatibility. Consider using MutationObserver instead.
This tests that we don't crash while creating a video element while a DOMSubtreeModified even handler is registered.

If you can see the movie below, the test passed.

SUCCESS: The test ran without crashing
