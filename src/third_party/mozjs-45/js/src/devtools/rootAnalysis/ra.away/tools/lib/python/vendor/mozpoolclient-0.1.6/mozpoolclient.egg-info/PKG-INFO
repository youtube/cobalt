Description: ==============
        Mozpool Client
        ==============
        
        The mozpool client allows you to interact with a Mozpool [1] instance through various
        APIs. This allows you to interact with various mobile devices that are managed
        by Mozpool. You can reboot the devices, query information about them
        and reimage them among many other actions.
        
        
        Introduction
        ============
        This code is extracted from the initial work from jhopkins in mozharness [2].
        Not all of the API has been implemented as the initial work did but and the tests
        have not yet been ported.
        
        Thanks to
        =========
        jhopkins for initial work in mozharness.
        dustin, dividehex, ted and mcote for creating all the pieces in the Mozpool stack.
