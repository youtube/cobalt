This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] Calling send() when data channel is in connecting state should throw InvalidStateError
[PASS] Datachannel should be able to send simple string and receive as string
[PASS] Datachannel should be able to send unicode string and receive as unicode string
[PASS] Datachannel should ignore binaryType and always receive string message as string
[PASS] Datachannel should be able to send an empty string and receive an empty string
[PASS] Datachannel should be able to send Uint8Array message and receive as ArrayBuffer
[PASS] Datachannel should be able to send ArrayBuffer message and receive as ArrayBuffer
[PASS] Datachannel should be able to send an empty ArrayBuffer message and receive as ArrayBuffer
[FAIL] Datachannel should be able to send Blob message and receive as ArrayBuffer
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
[FAIL] Datachannel should be able to send ArrayBuffer message and receive as Blob
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to set the 'binaryType' property on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
[FAIL] Datachannel binaryType should receive message as Blob by default
  assert_equals: Expect initial binaryType value to be blob expected "blob" but got "arraybuffer"
[FAIL] Datachannel sending multiple messages with different types should succeed and be received
  assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet Reached unreachable code
