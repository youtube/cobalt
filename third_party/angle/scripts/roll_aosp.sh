# This script is executed by the Skia roller in *AOSP* checkout (with new ANGLE changes merged into it by git merge).
# The Skia roller merges ANGLE changes and also has code to remove submodules and extra files.
# For local setup including the additional Skia roller actions see go/angle-skia-roller-local
#
# Some caveats due to the way this is set up:
# * If a file is deleted from AOSP by a previous commit to AOSP *and* is changed upstream in ANGLE,
#   git merge will fail in Skia roller before even reaching this script. This sometimes happens with e.g. .gitmodules
#
# * If a file is needed to run gn gen (commonly BUILD.gn) it might need to take a different path:
#
#   * If this file comes from ANGLE, it is already git-merged into AOSP by Skia roller by the time we get to this script
#      - example: ANGLE source files, but also e.g. third_party/jdk/BUILD.gn (see note below)
#
#   * If this file comes from a third_party dep (pulled by gclient in generate_Android_bp_file), it is either:
#      1. deleted after the codegen ensuring it is *not* in AOSP (delete_after_codegen_paths)
#      2. automatically ignored due to it being part of a sub-repo not this repo (.git subdirs in git deps but not cipd)
#      3. copied to AOSP intentionally by this script (copy_to_aosp_paths, which deletes .git subdirs to avoid the case 2)
#      4. copied to AOSP implicitly, without being in copy_to_aosp_paths:
#         - dep does not have a .git subdir (dep_type cipd in DEPS)
#         - not listed in delete_after_codegen_paths
#         - example: files under third_party/r8
#
#   Note: a file being under third_party/ does *not* necessarily imply it comes from a dep. For example third_party/jdk/BUILD.gn
#         comes from the ANGLE repo, not from the upstream Chromium third_pary/jdk repo.. but it can be different in other cases.
#         In cases like third_party/jdk/BUILD.gn, we need to make sure it is *not* part of delete_after_codegen_paths as
#         this script would delete this file from AOSP after one roll and the next roll would fail gn gen.
