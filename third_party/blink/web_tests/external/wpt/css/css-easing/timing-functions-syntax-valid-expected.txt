This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] e.style['animation-timing-function'] = "cubic-bezier(calc(-2), calc(0.7 / 2), calc(1.5), calc(0))" should set the property value
  assert_not_equals: property should be set got disallowed value ""
[FAIL] e.style['animation-timing-function'] = "cubic-bezier(0, sibling-index(), 1, sign(2em - 20px))" should set the property value
  assert_not_equals: property should be set got disallowed value ""
[FAIL] e.style['animation-timing-function'] = "steps(calc(1), jump-none)" should set the property value
  assert_not_equals: property should be set got disallowed value ""
Harness: the test ran to completion.
