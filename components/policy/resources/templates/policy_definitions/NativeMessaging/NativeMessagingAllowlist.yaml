caption: Configure native messaging allowlist
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies which native messaging hosts aren't subject to the deny list. A deny list value of <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph> means all native messaging hosts are denied, unless they're explicitly allowed.

        All native messaging hosts are allowed by default. But, if all native messaging hosts are denied by policy, the admin can use the allow list to change that policy.
