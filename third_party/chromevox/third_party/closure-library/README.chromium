Description:
Closure Library is a powerful, low level JavaScript library designed
for building complex and scalable web applications.

Local Modifications:
Only the files actually used by ChromeVox are kept. This includes a small
number of javaScript source files and a few python modules to scan sources for
closure dependencies.  In addition:
- closure/goog/i18n/messageformat.js was changed to:
  - use Number.prototype.toLocaleString() instead of goog.i18n.NumberFormat
  - use spread operator (...) instead of goog.array.copy()
- goog.i18n.LocaleFeature was removed from closure/goog/i18n/ordinalrules.js and
    closure/goog/i18n/pluralrules.js
- Calls to goog.module() were replaced by goog.provide() and appropriate scoping
- Most of closure/goog/string/string.js was deleted.  The only function
    left is goog.string.subs as it is needed by goog.asserts
