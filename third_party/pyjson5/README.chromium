Description:
A Python implementation of the JSON5 data format.

src/benchmarks/chromium.linux.json and src/benchmarks/chromium.perf.json
have both been modified by various CLs that apparently thought they
needed to modify these files as part of some other change. This
CL keeps the modified versions, rather than restoring the v0.9.10
versions, to minimize confusion in this roll.

TODO: Change the files in the pyjson5 repo to be other JSON files to
eliminate this source of confusion.
