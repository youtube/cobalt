caption: Enable two-factor authentication for remote access hosts
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Enables two-factor authentication for remote access hosts instead of a user-specified PIN.

            If this setting is enabled, then users must provide a valid two-factor code when accessing a host.

            If this setting is disabled or not set, then two-factor will not be enabled and the default behavior of having a user-defined PIN will be used.
