caption: Enable Renderer App Container
default: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means Renderer App Container configuration will be enabled on supported platforms.

        Setting the policy to Disabled has a detrimental effect on the security and stability of <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> as it will weaken the sandbox that renderer processes use. Only turn off the policy if there are compatibility issues with third-party software that must run inside renderer processes.

        Note: Read more about Process mitigation policies ( https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/design/sandbox.md#Process-mitigation-policies ).
