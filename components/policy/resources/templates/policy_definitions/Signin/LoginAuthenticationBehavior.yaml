caption: Configure the login authentication behavior
desc: |-
  When this policy is set, the login authentication flow will be in one of the following ways depending on the value of the setting:

        If set to GAIA, login will be done via the normal GAIA authentication flow.

        If set to SAML_INTERSTITIAL, login will automatically redirect to SAML IdP by default. The user is still allowed to go back to the normal GAIA login flow.

        Note: the additional user confirmation screen, which was shown on <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> until version 99, isn't displayed anymore. If SAML IdP isn't configured and this policy is set to SAML_INTERSTITIAL, redirect will fail with the 400 error.
