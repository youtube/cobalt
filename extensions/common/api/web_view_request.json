    "description": "Use the <code>chrome.webViewRequest</code> API to intercept, block, or modify requests in-flight. It is potentially faster than the <a href='webRequest'><code>chrome.webRequest</code> API</a> because you can register rules that are evaluated in the browser rather than the JavaScript engine, which reduces roundtrip latencies and allows higher efficiency."
