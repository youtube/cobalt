repoze.lru
==========

``repoze.lru`` is a LRU (least recently used) cache implementation.  Keys and
values that are not used frequently will be evicted from the cache faster
than keys and values that are used frequently.  It works under Python 2.5,
Python 2.6, Python 2.7, and Python 3.2.

Please see ``docs/index.rst`` for detailed documentation, or view them
