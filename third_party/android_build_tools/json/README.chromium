Description:
  Android's implementation of the org.json package. Used because org.json uses
  non-standard licenses.

Local Modifications:
* Removed all references to internal android code to avoid unecessary deps.
  These were just annotations (eg: NonNull, UnsupportedAppUsage, etc.).

What version is this:
  Latest at the time of landing. However, this has minimal usage and is not
  shipped and is not expected to need to be updated.
