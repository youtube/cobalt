    usage of the BeforeInstallPromptEvent, which allows developers to control
    when an app banner appears. The events in this histogram are not mutually
    exclusive - for example, preventDefault() must be called if prompt() is
    called.

    mode and *are not* WebAPKs. These are sites which do not meet the PWA

    non-PWA intents that were added to the homescreen *prior* to M57, as we
    cannot distinguish between them after they are added.
