caption: Use built-in DNS client
default: null
desc: |-
  This policy controls which software stack is used to communicate with the DNS server: the Operating System DNS client, or <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>'s built-in DNS client. This policy does not affect which DNS servers are used: if, for example, the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It also does not control if DNS-over-HTTPS is used; <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will always use the built-in resolver for DNS-over-HTTPS requests. Please see the <ph name="DNS_OVER_HTTPS_MODE_POLICY_NAME">DnsOverHttpsMode</ph> policy for information on controlling DNS-over-HTTPS.

        If this policy is set to Enabled or is left unset, the built-in DNS client will be used.

        If this policy is set to Disabled, the built-in DNS client will only be used when DNS-over-HTTPS is in use.
