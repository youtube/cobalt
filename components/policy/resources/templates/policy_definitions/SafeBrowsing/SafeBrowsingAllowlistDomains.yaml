caption: Configure the list of domains on which Safe Browsing will not trigger warnings.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means Safe Browsing will trust the domains you designate. It won't check them for dangerous resources such as phishing, malware, or unwanted software. Safe Browsing's download protection service won't check downloads hosted on these domains. Its password protection service won't check for password reuse.

  Leaving the policy unset means default Safe Browsing protection applies to all resources.

  This policy does not support regular expressions; however, subdomains of a given domain are allowlisted. Fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) are not required.

  On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph>, this policy is only available on instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> domain, joined to <ph name="MS_AAD_NAME">Microsoft® Azure® Active Directory®</ph> or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>.

  On <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph>, this policy is only available on instances that are managed via MDM, joined to a domain via MCX or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>.
