caption: Configure the list of domains for which the <ph name="PASSWORD_MANAGER_NAME">Password Manager</ph> (Save and
  Fill) will be disabled
desc: |-
  Configure the list of domains where <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> should disable the <ph name="PASSWORD_MANAGER_NAME">Password Manager</ph>. This means that Save and Fill workflows will be disabled, ensuring that passwords for those websites can't be saved or auto filled into web forms.

  If a domain is present in the list, the <ph name="PASSWORD_MANAGER_NAME">Password Manager</ph> will be disabled for it.

  If a domain is not present in the list, the <ph name="PASSWORD_MANAGER_NAME">Password Manager</ph> will be available for it.

  If the policy is unset, the <ph name="PASSWORD_MANAGER_NAME">Password Manager</ph> will be available for all domains.
