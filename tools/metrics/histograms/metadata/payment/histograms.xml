<histogram name="PaymentRequest.AddressEditorTrigerred"
    enum="PaymentRequestAddressEditorMode" expires_after="2025-08-28">
  <owner>vykochko@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>smcgruer@google.com</owner>
  <owner>payments-autofill-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Android specific metric. Recorded every time the address editor is opened
    from the Payment Request UI for either adding a new address or editing
    existing.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PaymentRequest.CanMakePayment.CallAllowedByPref"
    enum="Boolean" expires_after="2025-03-30">
  <owner>smcgruer@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether or not a call to the PaymentRequest.canMakePayment() API was allowed
    by the kCanMakePaymentEnabled user preference. This histogram does not
    reflect what the outcome of the canMakePayment call would have been, only if
    it was allowed or blocked by the preference. It is recorded once per
    PaymentRequest.canMakePayment call.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PaymentRequest.CheckoutFunnel"
    enum="PaymentRequestCheckoutFunnelSteps" expires_after="2025-03-09">
  <owner>rouslan@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>web-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Counts the number of Payment Requests (PR) that go through each checkout
    step. A single PR may be counted in multiple buckets depending on its final
    status. e.g. A completed PR will be counted in all of the following buckets
    1- Initiated, 2- show() called 3- Payment request triggered 4- Payment
    handler invoked, 5- Completed.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PaymentRequest.EventResponse.CanMakePayment" enum="Boolean"
    expires_after="2024-02-20">
  <owner>rouslan@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>web-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    A payment handler's response to the &quot;canmakepayment&quot; event in its
    service worker. The event is fired when &quot;new PaymentRequest()&quot; is
    called in JavaScript, but only for URL-based payment methods, only for
    already installed payment handlers, and only when not in private browsing
    mode. The response from &quot;canmakepayment&quot; is expected to be
    &quot;true&quot; in the majority of cases. The value of &quot;false&quot;
    could be either the payment handler refusing to make payments or an internal
    error, which should both be rare.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PaymentRequest.Events2" units="bitfield value"
    expires_after="2025-05-19">
  <owner>rouslan@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>web-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The 2.0 version of Events. A bitfield representing the different events that
    happened during the Payment Request.
  </summary>
</histogram>

    enum="Boolean" expires_after="2025-04-13">
  <owner>smcgruer@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether or not a call to the PaymentRequest.hasEnrolledInstrument() API was
    allowed by the kCanMakePaymentEnabled user preference. This histogram does
    not reflect what the outcome of the hasEnrolledInstrument call would have
    been, only if it was allowed or blocked by the preference. It is recorded
    once per PaymentRequest.hasEnrolledInstrument call.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram

    enum="Boolean" expires_after="2025-04-06">
  <owner>smcgruer@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether or not the 'payments.can_make_payment_enabled' pref is enabled when
    a PaymentRequest object is constructed. Recorded only when a PaymentRequest
    object is first constructed, and approximately once per startup
    (specifically, once per BrowserContext).

    The difference between this histogram and
    PaymentRequest.IsCanMakePaymentAllowedByPref.Startup is that this histogram
    is only recorded if/when the user visits a page that constructs a
    PaymentRequest object, which means that it sub-selects for users who are
    likely to be in a payment context.

    When the 'payments.can_make_payment_enabled' pref is disabled, this records
    the reason why (e.g., by the user, an extension, etc). Recorded only when a
    PaymentRequest object is first constructed, and approximately once per
    startup (specifically, once per BrowserContext).

    The difference between this histogram and
    PaymentRequest.IsCanMakePaymentAllowedByPref.Startup.DisabledReason is that

    enum="PaymentRequestTryShowOutcome" expires_after="2025-03-23">
  <owner>smcgruer@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The outcome of trying to show the PaymentRequest UI in response to
    PaymentRequest.show(), with regards only to whether the call is blocked due
    to an existing PaymentRequest.show() call being underway either in the same
    or another tab.

    Recorded per 'valid' call to PaymentRequest.show() - that is, does not
    include calls where show() was called twice on the same object, or the
    PaymentRequest wasn't initialized first, etc.

    Whether this metric records the show being allowed or not, it is important
    to note that there are subsequent steps in actually showing the
    PaymentRequest that may or could still fail. For example, the request could
    be being made from a background tab, which is checked later after this
    metric is recorded. As such, interpret this metric with care - it cannot be
    read as &quot;these calls succeed and these calls do not&quot;!
