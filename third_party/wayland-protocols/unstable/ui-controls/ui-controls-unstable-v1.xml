    <description summary="requests for input emulation">
      This global provides requests for different type of input emulation that
      mirror the semantics of Chrome's ui_controls functions.

      Additionally, there is a set_toplevel_bounds request to help with the
      implementation of automated UI testing in compositors that don't support
      aura_shell (i.e. Weston).
