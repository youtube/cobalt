// IME on ChromeOS consists of three parts:
// - The IME running in an extension to provide a soft keyboard
// - The sandboxed, core IME service running in ChromeOS (responsible for
//   processing input and turning it into characters/symbols)
// - The IME framework running in the Chrome browser process, that brokers
//   between the IME extension and the IME service. It also provides additional
//   functionality to the IME service (for downloading IME data as needed).
// TODO(b/214153032): Paraphrase and modernise this documentation block. There
// are currently quite some vague and/or oudated bits.

// Manages access to a set of IMEs, implemented by the IME service
// itself. The IME framework in the browser process is responsible for brokering
// the connection between the IME service and the IME extension, but does not
// otherwise participate.
