Description:
The Android NDK provides libraries and tools necessary for building, running,
and debugging C/C++ on Android. However, as Chromium builds it's own toolchain,
this directory only contains the following artifacts from the NDK:

1. simpleperf
2. sysroot
3. lldb and lldb-server

This allows us to use tracing and gdb support, while limiting our dependencies.

How to upgrade NDK:
1. Commit #1:
   * Assign `_URL` variable in `3pp/fetch.py` to point to the new file.
   * Edit `3pp/install.sh` as needed.
2. The builder for CIPD packagers
https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/ci/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
   should run (trigger if needed) with the commit. Wait for it to finish.
3. The `fetch.py` change leads to version code change, which triggers update in
   "latest" entry for the page:
https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/p/chromium/third_party/android_toolchain/android_toolchain
4. Commit #2:
   * Update the DEPS entry `src/third_party/android_toolchain/ndk` with the new
     Instance ID.
   * Update this README.chromium with the new version.
   * Update //build/config/android/config.gni ("default_android_ndk_version")
   * Add change log URL to commit message (e.g.: https://github.com/android/ndk/releases/tag/r26b)

Local Modifications:
* Removed files in the sysroot that conflict with other files when unzipped on
  case-insensitive filesystems (e.g. usr/include/netfilter/xt_CONNMARK.h).
