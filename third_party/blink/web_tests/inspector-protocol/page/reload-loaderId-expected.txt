Tests that reloading pages respects loaderId.
loaderId: <string>
Querying window.foo after reload (expect "undefined"): undefined
Now trying a reload with an incorrect loaderId
{
    error : {
        code : -32602
        message : Reload was discarded because the page already navigated
    }
    id : <number>
    sessionId : <string>
}
Now trying a reload with an outdated loaderId
{
    error : {
        code : -32602
        message : Reload was discarded because the page already navigated
    }
    id : <number>
    sessionId : <string>
}
