  Enable <ph name="CHROME_ENTERPRISE_DEVICE_TRUST_CONNECTOR">Chrome Enterprise Device Trust Connector</ph> for a list of URLs.

  Setting this policy specifies for which URLs <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will offer to start the attestation flow for managed profiles. The latter allows those websites to get an attested set of context-aware signals from the device.
  This policy can only be configured via the Chrome Enterprise Connectors page on the <ph name="GOOGLE_ADMIN_CONSOLE_PRODUCT_NAME">Google Admin console</ph>.

  Leaving this policy unset or empty means that no website will be able to start a user-level attestation flow and get signals from the device. However if the corresponding
  <ph name="BROWSER_CONTEXT_AWARE_ACCESS_SIGNALS_ALLOWLIST">BrowserContextAwareAccessSignalsAllowlist</ph> policy is enabled then the attestation flow can be started for the managed browser and device signals can be collected.

  For <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>, this policy is related to remote attestation where a certificate is automatically generated and uploaded to the server. For usage of the attestation flow on the device's login screen, please use the <ph name="DEVICE_LOGIN_SCREEN_CONTEXT_AWARE_ACCESS_SIGNALS_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">DeviceLoginScreenContextAwareAccessSignalsAllowlist</ph> policy.

  For detailed information on valid <ph name="URL_LABEL">URL</ph> patterns, please see https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format.
