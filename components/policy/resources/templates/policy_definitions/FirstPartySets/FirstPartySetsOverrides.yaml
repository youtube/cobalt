# TODO(b/313073098): Deprecate policy.
desc: |-
  This policy provides a way to override the list of sets the browser uses for First-Party Sets features.

  Each set in the browser's list of First-Party Sets must meet the requirements of a First-Party Set.
  A First-Party Set must contain a primary site and one or more member sites.
  A set can also contain a list of service sites that it owns, as well as a map from a site to all of its ccTLD variants.
  See https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets for more information on First-Party Sets are used by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

  All sites in a First-Party Set must be a registrable domain served over HTTPS. Each site in a First-Party Set must also be unique,
  meaning a site cannot be listed more than once in a First-Party Set.

  When this policy is given an empty dictionary, the browser uses the public list of First-Party Sets.

  For all sites in a First-Party Set from the <ph name="REPLACEMENTS">replacements</ph> list, if a site is also present
  on a First-Party Set in the browser's list, then that site will be removed from the browser's First-Party Set.
  After this, the policy's First-Party Set will be added to the browser's list of First-Party Sets.

  For all sites in a First-Party Set from the <ph name="ADDITIONS">additions</ph> list, if a site is also present
  on a First-Party Set in the browser's list, then the browser's First-Party Set will be updated so that the
  new First-Party Set can be added to the browser's list. After the browser's list has been updated,
  the policy's First-Party Set will be added to the browser's list of First-Party Sets.

  The browser's list of First-Party Sets requires that for all sites in its list, no site is in
  more than one set. This is also required for both the <ph name="REPLACEMENTS">replacements</ph> list
  and the <ph name="ADDITIONS">additions</ph> list. Similarly, a site cannot be in both the
  <ph name="REPLACEMENTS">replacements</ph> list and the <ph name="ADDITIONS">additions</ph> list.

  Wildcards (*) are not supported as a policy value, nor within any First-Party Set in these lists.

  All sets provided by the policy must be valid First-Party Sets, if they aren't then an
  appropriate error will be outputted.

  On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph>, this policy is only available on instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> domain, joined to <ph name="MS_AAD_NAME">Microsoft® Azure® Active Directory®</ph> or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>.

  On <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph>, this policy is only available on instances that are managed via MDM, joined to a domain via MCX or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>.

  This is the equivalent of the <ph name="RELATED_WEBSITE_SETS_OVERRIDES_POLICY_NAME">RelatedWebsiteSetsOverrides</ph> policy.
  Either policy may be used, but this one will be deprecated soon so the <ph name="RELATED_WEBSITE_SETS_OVERRIDES_POLICY_NAME">RelatedWebsiteSetsOverrides</ph> policy is preferred.
  They both have the same effect on the browser's behavior.
