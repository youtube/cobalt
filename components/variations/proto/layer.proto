// A Layer divides Variations clients into disjoint LayerMembers based on client
// entropy values, allowing potentially conflicting studies to be performed on
// separate client subsets.

// Each layer consists of N slots, and each Chrome client instance will randomly
// select a specific slot to be "active" within that layer based on the layer's
// salt and the client's entropy source value. That slot will be part of a range
// within a specific LayerMember. Each study that participates in a layer points
// to a particular LayerMember within that layer. Only the studies pointing to
// the active LayerMember will be active for a given client.
// Example:
//    LayerFoo:
//        num_slots=10: |0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9|
//        LayerMembers: <0   -   3>, <4     -       9>
//                        ^Member1^    ^Member2^.
//
//    In this example, the Member1 LayerMember has four slots and
//    Member2 has six out of ten total. This means studies pointing to
//    Member1 will receive ~40% of the population and Member2 ~60%.

  //   - Adding a `layer_member_id` will result in clients randomized to that
  //     layer member to be part of this study (and be randomized into its
