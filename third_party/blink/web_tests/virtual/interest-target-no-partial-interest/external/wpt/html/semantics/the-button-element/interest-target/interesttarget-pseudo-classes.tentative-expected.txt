This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Basic pseudo class function, with keyboard focus triggering
  assert_equals: focusing invoker shows partial interest (and therefore also interest): :has-partial-interest mismatch expected true but got false
[FAIL] Keyboard-triggered partial focus keeps contents from being keyboard focusable
  assert_equals: initial: :has-interest mismatch expected false but got true
[FAIL] Show interest hotkey confers "full interest", without any delays
  assert_equals: initial: :has-interest mismatch expected false but got true
[FAIL] Hovering the popover confers "full interest", without any delays
  assert_equals: initial: :has-interest mismatch expected false but got true
[FAIL] Hovering the invoker confers "full interest", without any delays
  assert_equals: initial: :has-interest mismatch expected false but got true
[FAIL] With full interest, contents are keyboard focusable
  assert_equals: initial: :has-interest mismatch expected false but got true
[FAIL] Lose interest hotkey works
  assert_equals: initial: :has-interest mismatch expected false but got true
[FAIL] Closing the target popover loses interest, without any delays (keyboard activation)
  assert_equals: initial: :has-interest mismatch expected false but got true
[FAIL] Closing the target popover loses interest, without any delays (mouse activation)
  assert_equals: initial: :has-interest mismatch expected false but got true
[FAIL] The pseudo classes only match after delays, once interest is shown
  assert_equals: initial: :has-interest mismatch expected false but got true
Harness: the test ran to completion.
