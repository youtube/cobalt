// Estimates the privacy budget cost for a set of identifiable surfaces.
//
// Random surface selection is guided by a rudimentary na√Øve costing model.
// _This model is in no way meant to resemble any model that will result from
// the identifiability study_. It currently has the following properties:
//
// * By default all surfaces are assumed to have a cost of 1 median surface.
//
//     * Units are in information exposed by a _median _surface. So sans
//       anything more specific the costing model assumes that a given surface
//       exposes a median amount of identifiable information _independently of
//       any other surface_.
//
//       This choice of unit has the desirable property of being compatible with
//       just counting the number of surfaces.
//
//     * The measure is proportional to the exposed Shannon entropy. I.e. if
//       a single unit corresponds to ùõÆ bits, then 2 units will correspond to 2ùõÆ
//       bits. Hence the information content of two independent identifiable
//       surfaces is the sum of the information content of each individual
//       surface.
//
// * The cost of any individual surface can be overridden on the basis of its
//   type or its identifier. This is for dealing with substantial deviations
//   from the median.
//
// * A group of surfaces can be treated as a single unit and be assigned a group
//   cost. This is useful, for example, if we want to select `Screen.width` and
//   `Screen.height` together so that any time we decide to include one we
//   implicitly include the other.
//
//   The set of surfaces that are considered as a unit for valuation purposes is
//   referred to in code as an "equivalence class" or "equivalence set."
//
// * Given a set of surfaces ùë∫ the cost of the set is the sum of:
//
//   * The costs of each surface that is _not_ a member of any equivalence
//     class.
//
//   * The cost of each equivalence class where at least one of the surfaces in
//     ùë∫ is a member.
