    Logs when a user action triggers a command in the bookmark manager. Commands
    can be triggered by keyboard shortcuts, menu items or other buttons in the
    UI.

    Revised in M-76 when the &quot;Open (double click/enter)&quot; bucket was
    split into two separate buckets, one for bookmarks and one for folders.

    This histogram is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

    Records how long ago (in days) the most recently saved bookmark was used.
    Only emitted if the user has a bookmark which has been opened. Days are
    computed by comparing the current time to the used time for the bookmark,
    this value is truncated (std::trunc behavior). Only emitted if there's a
    valid value which replaces the default SIZE_MAX value. The default SIZE_MAX
