caption: Enable automatic HTTPS upgrades

desc: |-
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> attempts to upgrade some
  navigations from HTTP to HTTPS, when possible. This policy can be used to
  disable this behavior. If set to "true" or left unset, this feature will be
  enabled by default.

  The separate <ph name="HTTP_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">HttpAllowlist</ph> policy
  can be used to exempt specific hostnames or hostname patterns from being
  upgraded to HTTPS by this feature.

  See also the <ph name="HTTPS_ONLY_MODE_POLICY_NAME">HttpsOnlyMode</ph> policy.
