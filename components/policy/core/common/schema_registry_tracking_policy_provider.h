namespace policy {

// A policy provider that relies on a delegate provider to obtain policy
// settings, but uses a different SchemaRegistry to determine which policy
// namespaces to request from the delegate provider.
//
// This provider tracks the SchemaRegistry's state, and becomes ready after
// making sure the delegate provider has refreshed its policies with an updated
// view of the complete schema. It is expected that the delegate's
// SchemaRegistry is a CombinedSchemaRegistry tracking the
// SchemaRegistryTrackingPolicyProvider's registry.
//
// This policy provider implementation is used to wrap the platform policy
// provider for use with individual profiles, which may have different
// SchemaRegistries. The SchemaRegistryTrackingPolicyProvider ensures that
// initialization completion is only signaled for non-Chrome PolicyDomains after
// the SchemaRegistry is fully initialized. This is important to avoid flapping
// on startup due to asynchronous SchemaRegistry initialization while the
// underlying policy provider has already completed initialization.
//
// A concrete example of this is POLICY_DOMAIN_EXTENSIONS, which registers
// the PolicyNamespaces for the different extensions it's interested in based
// on what extensions are installed in a Profile. Before that happens, the
// underlying policy providers will not load the corresponding policy, so at
// startup there would be a window during which the policy appears to be not
// present. This is avoided by only flagging POLICY_DOMAIN_EXTENSIONS ready
// once the corresponding SchemaRegistry has been fully initialized with the
// list of installed extensions.
