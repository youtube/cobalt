caption: Restore permissive Chrome Apps <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph> behavior

desc: |-
  Chrome Apps <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph> allows for
  behavior which is in the process of being removed from
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

  The previous behavior allows the
  <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph>
  <ph name="NEWWINDOW_EVENT_NAME">newwindow</ph> event
  (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webviewTag/#event-newwindow)
  to attach the new window to a <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph>
  element in a separate App window from the originating
  <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph>. With the new behavior, this
  attachment is still allowed, however the window reference returned from the
  call to <ph name="WINDOW_OPEN_NAME">window.open</ph> in the originating
  <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph> is invalidated.

  If enabled, the previous behavior is used.
  If disabled or unset, the behavior change takes effect as it is rolled
  out through the <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>
  release process.

  This policy is a temporary workaround in the event that enterprises
  experience breakage due to this change. The last supported version of this
  policy was version 121. It was removed in version 122.

# On ChromeOS, this policy should reach an LTS release before being removed.
supported_on:
- chrome.*:113-121
- chrome_os:113-121
- fuchsia:113-121

deprecated: true

# While this policy on its own could be dynamic, the GuestView MPArch
# migration (crbug.com/1261928), which depends on this policy being disabled,
# would not be able to handle dynamic changes.
