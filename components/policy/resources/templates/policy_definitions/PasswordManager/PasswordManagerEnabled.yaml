caption: Enable saving passwords to the password manager
desc: |-
  This policy controls the browser's ability to automatically remember passwords on websites and save them in the built-in password manager. It does not limit access or change the contents of passwords saved in the password manager and possibly synchronized to the Google account profile and <ph name="ANDROID_NAME">Android</ph>.

  Setting the policy to Enabled means users have <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> remember passwords and provide them the next time they sign in to a site.

  Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't save new passwords, but previously saved passwords will still work.

  If the policy is set, users can't change it in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>. If not set, the user can turn off password saving.
