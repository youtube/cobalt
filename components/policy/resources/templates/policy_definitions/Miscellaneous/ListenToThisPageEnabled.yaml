caption: Enable read aloud (text distillation and text-to-speech synthesis) for web pages
default: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to be true allows users to have eligible web
  pages read aloud using text-to-speech. This is achieved by server
  side content distillation and audio synthesis. Setting to false
  disables this feature. If this policy is set to default or unset,
  read aloud is enabled.
