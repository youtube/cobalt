Description:
Contain support for ICC color profile on top of jpeg6b (and up) library.
Original author is Tom Lane, from the IJG group.
We include the relevant part of the original IJG licensing term
in the file LICENSE.

Documentation for ICC profile can be found at: http://www.color.org

Local Modifications:
* Added Copyright in same form as libjpeg with dates from LICENSE file.
* On BSD platforms we might need to include to correct header file from
  the system, so a USE_SYSTEM_LIBJPEG ifdef is added to iccjpeg.h in order
  to be able to decide which jpeglib.h header to include.
