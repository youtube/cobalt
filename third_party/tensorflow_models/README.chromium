Description:
The TensorFlow Model Garden is a repository with a number of different
implementations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and modeling solutions for
TensorFlow users.

Important: Only a small selection of the upstream files are actually committed
here. See update.sh in this directory.

Note:
There are two shim directories, "libutf" and "icu4c", used to redirect
includes for those directories to their Chromium versions which have slightly
different names than those used here.

Update Process/Notes:
The owners update this repository as needed, using the `update.sh` script. If
you need to roll this library sooner, please reach out to one of the owners so
all the dependencies and necessary validation tests can be run.
