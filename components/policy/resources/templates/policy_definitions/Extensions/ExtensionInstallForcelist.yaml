arc_support: Android apps can be force-installed from the Google Admin console using
  Google Play. They do not use this policy.
caption: Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies a list of apps and extensions that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off. Permissions are granted implicitly, including for the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs. (These 2 APIs aren't available to apps and extensions that aren't force-installed.)

  Leaving the policy unset means no apps or extensions are autoinstalled, and users can uninstall any app or extension in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

  This policy supersedes <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionInstallBlocklist</ph> policy. If a previously force-installed app or extension is removed from this list, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> automatically uninstalls it.

  The source code of any extension may be altered by users through developer tools, potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional. If this is a concern, set the <ph name="DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DISABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeveloperToolsDisabled</ph> policy.

  Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an update URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found, for example, on chrome://extensions when in Developer mode. If specified, the update URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate ). The update URL should use one of the following schemes: <ph name="HTTP_SCHEME">http</ph>, <ph name="HTTPS_SCHEME">https</ph> or <ph name="FILE_SCHEME">file</ph>. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used. The update URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension use the update URL in the extension's manifest. The update url for subsequent updates can be overridden using the <ph name="EXTENSION_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionSettings</ph> policy, see http://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=Configure_ExtensionSettings_policy.

  On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph> instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be forced installed if the instance is joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> domain, joined to <ph name="MS_AAD_NAME">Microsoft® Azure® Active Directory®</ph> or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>.

  On <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph> instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be force installed if the instance is managed via MDM, joined to a domain via MCX or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>.

  Note: This policy doesn't apply to Incognito mode. Read about hosting extensions ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting ).
