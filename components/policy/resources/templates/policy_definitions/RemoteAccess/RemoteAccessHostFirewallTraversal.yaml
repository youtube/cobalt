caption: Enable firewall traversal from remote access host
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset allows the usage of STUN servers, letting remote clients discover and connect to this machine, even if separated by a firewall.

        Setting the policy to Disabled when outgoing UDP connections are filtered by the firewall means the machine only allows connections from client machines within the local network.
