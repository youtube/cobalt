caption: Make SharedWorker blob URL behavior aligned with the specification
desc: |-
  Upon https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#control-and-use-worker-client,
  workers should inherit controllers for the blob URL.  However, existing code
  allows only DedicatedWorkers to inherit the controller, and SharedWorkers do
  not inherit the controller.

  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> inherit the controller
  if a blob URL is used as a SharedWorker URL.

  Setting the policy to Disabled leaves the behavior not aligned with the
  specification as-is.

  This policy is intended to be temporary and will be removed in the future.
