# Starboard Module Reference: `thread.h`

Defines functionality related to thread creation and cleanup.

## Macros

### kSbThreadContextInvalid

Well-defined value for an invalid thread context.

### kSbThreadInvalidId

Well-defined constant value to mean "no thread ID."

### kSbThreadSamplerInvalid

Well-defined value for an invalid thread sampler.

## Enums

### SbThreadPriority

A spectrum of thread priorities. Platforms map them appropriately to their own
priority system. Note that scheduling is platform-specific, and what these
priorities mean, if they mean anything at all, is also platform-specific.

In particular, several of these priority values can map to the same priority on
a given platform. The only guarantee is that each lower priority should be
treated less-than-or-equal-to a higher priority.

#### Values

*   `kSbThreadPriorityLowest`

    The lowest thread priority available on the current platform.
*   `kSbThreadPriorityLow`

    A lower-than-normal thread priority, if available on the current platform.
*   `kSbThreadPriorityNormal`

    Really, what is normal? You should spend time pondering that question more
    than you consider less-important things, but less than you think about more-
    important things.
*   `kSbThreadPriorityHigh`

    A higher-than-normal thread priority, if available on the current platform.
*   `kSbThreadPriorityHighest`

    The highest thread priority available on the current platform that isn't
    considered "real-time" or "time-critical," if those terms have any meaning
    on the current platform.
*   `kSbThreadPriorityRealTime`

    If the platform provides any kind of real-time or time-critical scheduling,
    this priority will request that treatment. Real-time scheduling generally
    means that the thread will have more consistency in scheduling than non-
    real-time scheduled threads, often by being more deterministic in how
    threads run in relation to each other. But exactly how being real-time
    affects the thread scheduling is platform-specific.

    For platforms where that is not offered, or otherwise not meaningful, this
    will just be the highest priority available in the platform's scheme, which
    may be the same as kSbThreadPriorityHighest.
*   `kSbThreadNoPriority`

    Well-defined constant value to mean "no priority." This means to use the
    default priority assignment method of that platform. This may mean to
    inherit the priority of the spawning thread, or it may mean a specific
    default priority, or it may mean something else, depending on the platform.

## Typedefs

### SbThreadContext

A handle to the context of a frozen thread.

#### Definition

```
typedef SbThreadContextPrivate* SbThreadContext
```

### SbThreadId

An ID type that is unique per thread.

#### Definition

```
typedef int32_t SbThreadId
```

### SbThreadSampler

A handle to a thread sampler.

#### Definition

```
typedef SbThreadSamplerPrivate* SbThreadSampler
```

## Functions

### SbThreadContextGetPointer

Gets the specified pointer-type `property` from the specified `context`. Returns
`true` if successful and `out_value` has been modified, otherwise returns
`false` and `out_value` is not modified.

#### Declaration

```
bool SbThreadContextGetPointer(SbThreadContext context, SbThreadContextProperty property, void **out_value)
```

### SbThreadContextIsValid

Returns whether the given thread context is valid.

#### Declaration

```
static bool SbThreadContextIsValid(SbThreadContext context)
```

### SbThreadGetId

Returns the Thread ID of the currently executing thread.

#### Declaration

```
SbThreadId SbThreadGetId()
```

### SbThreadGetPriority

Get the thread priority of the current thread.

#### Declaration

```
bool SbThreadGetPriority(SbThreadPriority *priority)
```

### SbThreadIsValidId

Returns whether the given thread ID is valid.

#### Declaration

```
static bool SbThreadIsValidId(SbThreadId id)
```

### SbThreadIsValidPriority

Returns whether the given thread priority is valid.

#### Declaration

```
static bool SbThreadIsValidPriority(SbThreadPriority priority)
```

### SbThreadSamplerCreate

Creates a new thread sampler for the specified `thread`.

If successful, this function returns the newly created handle. If unsuccessful,
this function returns `kSbThreadSamplerInvalid`.

#### Declaration

```
SbThreadSampler SbThreadSamplerCreate(pthread_t thread)
```

### SbThreadSamplerDestroy

Destroys the `sampler` and frees whatever resources it was using.

#### Declaration

```
void SbThreadSamplerDestroy(SbThreadSampler sampler)
```

### SbThreadSamplerFreeze

Suspends execution of the thread that `sampler` was created for.

If successful, this function returns a `SbThreadContext` for the frozen thread,
from which properties may be read while the thread remains frozen. If
unsuccessful, this function returns `kSbThreadContextInvalid`.

#### Declaration

```
SbThreadContext SbThreadSamplerFreeze(SbThreadSampler sampler)
```

### SbThreadSamplerIsSupported

Whether the current platform supports thread sampling. The result of this
function must not change over the course of the program, which means that the
results of this function may be cached indefinitely. If this returns false,
`SbThreadSamplerCreate` will return an invalid sampler.

#### Declaration

```
bool SbThreadSamplerIsSupported()
```

### SbThreadSamplerIsValid

Returns whether the given thread sampler is valid.

#### Declaration

```
static bool SbThreadSamplerIsValid(SbThreadSampler sampler)
```

### SbThreadSamplerThaw

Resumes execution of the thread that `sampler` was created for. This invalidates
the context returned from `SbThreadSamplerFreeze`.

#### Declaration

```
bool SbThreadSamplerThaw(SbThreadSampler sampler)
```

### SbThreadSetPriority

Set the thread priority of the current thread.

#### Declaration

```
bool SbThreadSetPriority(SbThreadPriority priority)
```
