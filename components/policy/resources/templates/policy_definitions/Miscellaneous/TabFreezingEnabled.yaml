caption: Allow background tabs freeze
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Controls whether <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> can freeze tabs that have been in the background for at least 5 minutes.

        If the policy is set to true, tabs that have been in the background for at least 5 minutes may be frozen. Tab freezing reduces CPU, battery and memory usage. <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> uses heuristics to avoid freezing tabs that do useful work in the background (e.g. display notifications, play sound, stream video). Web developers can also opt-out their site from freezing (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/chrome/browser/performance_manager/docs/freezing_opt_out_opt_in.md).

        If the policy is set to false, no tabs will be frozen.
