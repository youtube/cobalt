caption: Control use of the WebPrinting API
default: null
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to 2 automatically blocks sites from using the WebPrinting API.

  Setting the policy to 3 will prompt the user when a site wants to use the WebPrinting API.

  Leaving it unset lets websites ask for local printer access, but users can change this setting.
