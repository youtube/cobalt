  In-viewport images get re-prioritized if layout is computed mid-flight. With fetchpriority=low, re-prioritization should have no effect,
  we delay both the image request (will be fetched by preload scanner) by a second, and finish layout mid-flight. As long as the final
  resource load priority is kLow, we know the image was not re-prioritized.
