  If this policy is enabled, extensions that are unpublished on the Chrome Web
  Store will be disabled on <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.
  This policy only applies to extensions that are installed and updated from the
  Chrome Web Store. Off-store extensions such as unpacked extensions installed
  using developer mode and extensions installed using the command-line switch
  are ignored. Force-installed extensions that do not update from the
  Chrome Web Store and all version-pinned extensions are also ignored.

  If the policy is set to <ph name="ALLOW_UNPUBLISHED">AllowUnpublished</ph> (0) or not set, extensions that are unpublished on the Chrome Web Store are allowed.
  If the policy is set to <ph name="DISABLE_UNPUBLISHED">DisableUnpublished</ph> (1), extensions that are unpublished on the Chrome Web Store are disabled.
