<body onload="test();" onpagehide="ping();">
  Test case for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30457. Previously, if an image<br>
  load was trigger from an pagehide handler, we would kill it almost immediately due to the<br>
  navigation stopping all loaders. These loads now happen entirely in the background and detached<br>
  from the DOM, so they're invisible to the normal resource load callback infrastructure. We generate a<br>
  timestamp, then in the pagehide handler, we load an 'image' (actually a php script) that takes the<br>
  timestamp as a parameter and saves it to a file. The destination page is a php script that checks for<br>
  the existence of that file and passes the test if the file contains the expected timestamp.<br>
