caption: Allow WebDriver to Override Incompatible Policies
deprecated: true
desc: |2-

        This policy was removed in M80, because it is not necessary anymore as
        WebDriver is now compatible with all existing policies.

        This policy allows users of the WebDriver feature to override policies which can interfere with its operation.

        Currently this policy disables SitePerProcess and IsolateOrigins policies.

        If the policy is enabled, WebDriver will be able to override incompatible policies.

        If the policy is disabled or not configured, WebDriver will not be allowed to override incompatible policies.
