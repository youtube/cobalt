default: null

  Setting the policy specifies whether Isolated Web Apps will by default be able to connect to smart card readers.

  Setting the policy to 3 or leaving it unset allows Isolated Web App origins to ask for permission to connect to smart card readers. Leaving it unset also allows users to change this setting.

  Setting the policy to 2 blocks Isolated Web App origins from connecting to smart card readers.

  This policy can be overridden for specific Isolated Web App origins using the <ph name="SMART_CARD_CONNECT_ALLOWED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">SmartCardConnectAllowedForUrls</ph> and <ph name="SMART_CARD_CONNECT_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">SmartCardConnectBlockedForUrls</ph> policies.
