arc_support: This policy can also be used to specify Android apps as default file handlers.
caption: Assigns apps as default handlers for specified file extensions
desc: |-
  This policy allows the admins to specify apps that act as default handlers for the respective file extensions
  on <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> that users can't change.

  For all file extensions not specified in the policy, users are free to set their own defaults with respect to
  the usual workflow.

  Specify Chrome apps by their ID, such as <ph name="DEFAULT_HANDLERS_FOR_FILE_EXTENSIONS_POLICY_CHROME_APP_EXAMPLE">pjkljhegncpnkpknbcohdijeoejaedia</ph>;
  Web apps by the URL used in <ph name="WEB_APP_INSTALL_FORCE_LIST_POLICY_NAME">WebAppInstallForceList</ph>, such as <ph name="DEFAULT_HANDLERS_FOR_FILE_EXTENSIONS_POLICY_WEB_APP_EXAMPLE">https://google.com/maps</ph>;
  Android apps by their package name, such as <ph name="DEFAULT_HANDLERS_FOR_FILE_EXTENSIONS_POLICY_ANDROID_APP_EXAMPLE">com.google.android.gm</ph>;
  System Web Apps by their snake case name, such as <ph name="DEFAULT_HANDLERS_FOR_FILE_EXTENSIONS_POLICY_SYSTEM_WEB_APP_EXAMPLE">projector</ph>.

  Note that apps MUST declare themselves as file handlers for specified file extensions in the manifest in order for
  that policy item to take effect (i.e. the policy does NOT extend existing app capabilities).

  Leaving the policy unset allows <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> to select default handlers according to the internal logic.
