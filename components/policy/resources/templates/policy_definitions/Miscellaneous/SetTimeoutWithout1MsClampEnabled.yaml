caption: Control Javascript setTimeout() function minimum timeout.
default: null
deprecated: true
desc: "When the policy is set to Enabled, the Javascript setTimeout() with a timeout\
  \ of 0ms will not clamp to 1ms.\n          When the policy is set to Disabled, \
  \ the Javascript setTimeout() with a timeout of 0ms will clamp to 1ms.\n       \
  \   When the policy is unset, use the browser's default behavior for setTimeout()\
  \ function clamp.\n\n          This is a web standards compliant feature, but it\
  \ may change task ordering\n          on a web page, leading to unexpected behavior\
  \ on sites that are dependent on\n          a certain ordering in some way. It also\
  \ may affect sites with a lot of setTimeout()\n          with a timeout of 0ms usage,\
  \ e.g. increasing CPU load.\n\n          For users where this policy is unset, Chrome\
  \ will roll out the change gradually on the stable channel.\n\n          This policy\
  \ was removed in Chrome 110.\n                                        "
