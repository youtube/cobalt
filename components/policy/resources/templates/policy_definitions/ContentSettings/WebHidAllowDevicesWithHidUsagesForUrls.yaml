caption: Automatically grant permission to these sites to connect to HID devices containing
  top-level collections with the given HID usage.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets you list the URLs that specify which sites are automatically granted permission to access a HID device containing a top-level collection with the given HID usage. Each item in the list requires both <ph name="USAGES_FIELD_NAME">usages</ph> and <ph name="URLS_FIELD_NAME">urls</ph> fields for the policy to be valid. Each item in the <ph name="USAGES_FIELD_NAME">usages</ph> field must have a <ph name="USAGE_PAGE_FIELD_NAME">usage_page</ph> and may have a <ph name="USAGE_FIELD_NAME">usage</ph> field. Omitting the <ph name="USAGE_FIELD_NAME">usage</ph> field will create a policy matching any device containing a top-level collection with a usage from the specified usage page. An item which has a <ph name="USAGE_FIELD_NAME">usage</ph> field without a <ph name="USAGE_PAGE_FIELD_NAME">usage_page</ph> field is invalid and is ignored.

        Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="DEFAULT_WEB_HID_GUARD_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultWebHidGuardSetting</ph> applies, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

        URLs in this policy shouldn't conflict with those configured through <ph name="WEB_HID_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">WebHidBlockedForUrls</ph>. If they do, this policy takes precedence over <ph name="WEB_HID_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">WebHidBlockedForUrls</ph>.
