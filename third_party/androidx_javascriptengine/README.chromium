Description:
The WebView team is shipping this client library that can be used by Android apps to evaluate JavaScript and WASM.
The library is a thin interface built and shipped through AndroidX.

The actual service implementation of this library is shipped via the Android WebView APK.
In order to enable local development and end to end testing,
we mirror the JavaScriptEngine library into Chromium.

Since we require only a directory from the AndroidX repository, we mirror a git repository
created to track changes in the subdirectory in AndroidX. This addition repository is
maintained by the Git Infra team.

Local Modifications: None
