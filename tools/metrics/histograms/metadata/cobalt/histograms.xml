<histogram name="HangWatcher.IsThreadHung.BrowserProcess.RendererThread"
    enum="BooleanHung" expires_after="never">
  <owner>antonlunev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Every 10 seconds, a boolean is recorded to this histogram to indicate
    whether the RendererThread of a Browser process was hung. The thread is hung
    if the current work unit started running more than 10 seconds ago. This is
    emitted only in single process mode(when renderer is a thread inside
    BrowserProcess).
