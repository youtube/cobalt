# ChromeVox (for developers)

ChromeVox is the built-in screen reader on Chrome OS. It was originally
developed as a separate extension but now the code lives inside of the Chromium
tree and it's built as part of Chrome OS.

NOTE: ChromeVox ships also as an extension on the Chrome webstore. This version
of ChromeVox is known as ChromeVox Classic and is loosely related to ChromeVox
(on Chrome OS). All references to ChromeVox relate only to ChromeVox on Chrome
OS.

To start or stop ChromeVox, press Ctrl+Alt+Z at any time.

## Developer Info

Code location: ```chrome/browser/resources/chromeos/accessibility/chromevox```

Ninja target: it's built as part of "chrome", but you can build and run
browser_tests to test it (Chrome OS target only - you must have target_os =
"chromeos" in your GN args first).

## Developing On Linux

ChromeVox for Chrome OS development is done on Linux.

See [ChromeVox on Desktop Linux](chromevox_on_desktop_linux.md)
for more information.

## Debugging ChromeVox

There are options available that may assist in debugging ChromeVox. Here are a
few use cases.

### Feature development

When developing a new feature, it may be helpful to save time by not having to
go through a compile cycle. This can be achieved by setting
```chromevox_compress_js``` to 0 in
chrome/browser/resources/chromeos/accessibility/chromevox/BUILD.gn, or by using
a debug build.

In a debug build or with chromevox_compress_js off, the unflattened files in the
Chrome out directory
(e.g. out/Release/resources/chromeos/accessibility/chromevox/). Now you
can hack directly on the copy of ChromeVox in out/ and toggle ChromeVox to pick
up your changes (via Ctrl+Alt+Z).

### Fixing bugs

The easiest way to debug ChromeVox is from an external browser. Start Chrome
with this command-line flag:

```out/Release/chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222```

Now open http://localhost:9222 in a separate instance of the browser, and debug the ChromeVox extension background page from there.

Another option is to use emacs indium (available through M-x
package-list-packages).

It also talks to localhost:9222 but integrates more tightly into emacs instead.

Another option is to use the built-in developer console. Go to the
ChromeVox options page with Search+Shift+o, o; then, substitute the
“options.html” path with “background.html”, and then open up the
inspector.

### Debugging ChromeOS

To debug ChromeVox in ChromeOS, you need to add the command-line flag to the
config file in device under test(DUT) instead of starting chrome from command
line.

```
(dut) $ echo " --remote-debugging-port=9222 " >> /etc/chrome_dev.conf
(dut) $ restart ui
```

This is also written in
[Simple Chrome Workflow Doc](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/simple_chrome_workflow.md#command_line-flags-and-environment-variables).

You need to ssh from your development device into your DUT forwarding port 9222
to open ChromeVox extension background page in your dev device, for example
```
ssh my_crbook -L 3333:localhost:9222
```

Then open the forwarded port in the development device, http://localhost:3333 in
the example.

You may need to remove rootfs verification to write to `/etc/chrome_dev.conf`.

```
(dut) $ crossystem dev_boot_signed_only=0
(dut) $ sudo /usr/share/vboot/bin/make_dev_ssd.sh --remove_rootfs_verification
(dut) $ reboot
```

See
[Chromium OS Doc](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/developer_mode.md#disable-verity)
for more information about removing rootfs verification.

### Running tests

Build the browser_tests target. To run lots of tests in parallel, run it like
this:

```
out/Release/browser_tests --test-launcher-jobs=20 --gtest_filter=ChromeVox*
```

Use a narrower test filter if you only want to run some of the tests. For
example, most of the ChromeVox Next tests have "E2E" in them (for "end-to-end"),
so to only run those:

```out/Release/browser_tests --test-launcher-jobs=20 --gtest_filter="*ChromeVox*E2E*"```

## Code Structure

The `chromevox/` extension directory is broken into subdirectories, based on what context
the code runs in. The different contexts are as follows:

* The background context (`chromevox/background/`) contains the bulk of the ChromeVox logic,
and runs in the background page (soon to be a background service worker).

* The content script context (`chromevox/injected/`) contains the code that is injected into
web pages. At this point, this is only used to support the Google Docs workaround. When that
is resolved, it is anticipated this directory will be removed.

* The learn mode context (`chromevox/learn_mode/`) contains the code to render and run the
ChromeVox learn mode (which is different from the tutorial).

* The log context (`chromevox/log_page/`) contains the code specific to showing the ChromeVox
log page.

* The options context (`chromevox/options/`) contains the code for the ChromeVox settings page.
There is an ongoing effort to migrate this page into the ChromeOS settings app, after which
this directory will be unneeded.

* The panel context (`chromevox/panel/`) contains the code that renders and performs the logic
of the ChromeVox panel, shown at the top of the screen. When the onscreen command menus are
shown, that is also rendered in this context.

* The tutorial context (`chromevox/tutorial/`) contains resources used exclusively by the
ChromeVox tutorial.

Other subdirectories also have specific purposes:

* The common directory (`chromevox/common/`) contains files that can safely be shared between
multiple contexts. These files must have no global state, as each context has its own global
namespace. To get information between the contexts, bridge objects are used to pass structured
messages. Any data passed through these bridges loses any and all class information, as it is
converted to JSON in the process of being sent.

* The earcons directory (`chromevox/earcons/`) contains the audio files for any short indicator
sounds (earcons) used by ChromeVox to express information without words.

* The images directory (`chromevox/images/`) contains any images used in any context.

* The testing directory (`chromevox/testing/`) contains files that are used exclusively in
testing.

* The third_party directory (`chromevox/third_party`) contains open source code from other
developers that is used in the ChromeVox extension.

* The tools directory (`chromevox/tools`) contains python scrips used for building ChromeVox.
Eventually these should be moved into the common accessibility directory.
