  <variant name="IncludingMismatch."
      summary="The last session app version does not match the current app's
               version. This is very common on app updates, which would
               otherwise lead to losing multiple days of data. Instead,
               record them here."/>

<variants name="MXVersion">
  <variant name=""
      summary="Warning: This is only recorded when the current app version
               number matches the version number for all the data received in
               a MetricKit payload. Since MetricKit payloads are received
               once every 24 hours, this means that payloads received within
               24 hours of updating the app will get dropped. As a result,
               there will be a substantial decrease in histogram volume when
               a new app version is released, biasing the collected data
               towards users who are slow to update, and possibly creating
               spurious regressions or progressions. This histogram will have
               misleading trends around release dates. The version of this
               metric prefixed by IOS.MetricKit.IncludingMismatch does not
               drop data this way, so will not have these spurious changes."/>
  <variant name="IncludingMismatch."
      summary="Warning: This is recorded even when the current app version
               number doesn't match the version number for some or all of the
               data received in a MetricKit payload. This means that data
               reported for a particular Chrome version may actually be
               coming from an earlier version that the user was running
               within the previous 24 hours. Splitting this histogram by
               version number will yield misleading results, as some data
               attributed to be from a particular version will have been
               actually recorded for a different version number. The version
               of this metric that does not contain IncludingMismatch in its
               name drops data from older versions, so is safe to split by
               version number."/>

    The durations of time in which the app is too busy to handle user input
    responsively. This covers all forms of user input, including all touch
    screen input (scrolls, pinches, and taps) and input from any connected input
    device such as a keyboard. Logged when a MXMetricPayload is received (one
    per day). Each sample corresponds to one hang that happens when the app is
    in the foreground and doesn't respond quickly enough to user input. The
    minimum observed hang time is 250ms (but this value may change in future
    device/OS version). This metric can be normalized by comparing the total
    number of hangs or the total time spent hung against the number of clients
    emitting to IOS.MetricKit.ForegroundTimePerDay (hangs per users) or against
    the total time reported by IOS.MetricKit.ForegroundTimePerDay (fraction of
    foreground time spent in hangs). ApplicationHangTime and
    ForegroundTimePerDay have the same restrictions about when they're emitted
    (opted-in to share diagnostic data with Apple and also opted-in to UMA).
    Further, as hangs can only happen during foreground use,
    ForegroundTimePerDay makes a good comparison point. Only hangs in the
    browser process are reported.

  <summary>
    Logs the amount of time it takes for Chrome to process an incoming
    notification. iOS allows applications to process notifications and fetch any
    additional data needed for up to 30 seconds. iOS tracks the amount of power
    Chrome uses, the time it takes for it to finish processing the incoming
    notification, and data costs for background downloads. According to the
    documentation, if iOS determines that Chrome uses significant amounts of
    power when processing remote notifications, iOS may not always wake up
    Chrome early to process future notifications. Thus, this histogram uses
    processing time as a proxy for iOS' three parameters.

    Logs various lifecycle stages a push notification can observe on the device.
    This histogram is logged each time a push notification is received on the
    device, displayed while Chrome is in the foreground, and tapped by the user.
    An important stipulation to note is that if Chrome is neither in the
    foreground nor the background and a push notification is received on the
    device, iOS will not notify Chrome of this reception and thus will not be
    represented in the histogram. Therefore, when interpreting this metric, the
    push notification reception count may be lower than in reality.

    Counts the number of Chrome Siri Shortcuts that the user has created in the

    shortcuts that have multiple actions are not counted if at least one action
    isn't a Chrome-provided one. For example, a shortcut that opens URLs in
    Chrome and then opens URLs in another app won't be counted. As such, this
    metric undercounts the true number of Chrome shortcuts. This is a

  <summary>
    The number of application launches per &quot;cold start&quot;. (A &quot;cold
    start&quot; is an application launch which occurs when the app is not
    already running in the background.) Even when the application is in the
    background, the system may keep it alive if the resource usage is low. This
    will result in subsequent launches being faster by resuming the exisiting
    launched application instead of requiring a full, new launch. In the context
    of feature experiments, a decrease in this metric may signal that a feature
    is doing more work than necessary while the application is in the background
    and thus being terminated more frequently by the system.

  <summary>
    This event is recorded on application launch when the app was not already
    running in the background (a &quot;cold start&quot;). The value represents
    how many times the application was brought to the foreground while already
    running in the background (a &quot;warm start&quot;) during the previous
    session. Cold starts are slower because the entire application must be
    re-launched, while warm starts are merely a transistion from background to
    foreground state. In the context of feature experiments, a decrease in this
    metric may signal that a feature is doing more work than necessary while the
    application is in the background and thus being terminated more frequently
    by the system. NOTE: This metric is logged for the prior session, which may
    have been a different application version than the version logging this
    metric.
