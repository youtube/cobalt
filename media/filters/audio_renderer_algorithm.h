// AudioRendererAlgorithm buffers and transforms audio data. The owner of
// this object provides audio data to the object through EnqueueBuffer() and
// requests data from the buffer via FillBuffer().
//
// This class is *not* thread-safe. Calls to enqueue and retrieve data must be
// locked if called from multiple threads.
//
// AudioRendererAlgorithm uses the Waveform Similarity Overlap and Add (WSOLA)
// algorithm to stretch or compress audio data to meet playback speeds less than
// or greater than the natural playback of the audio stream. The algorithm
// preserves local properties of the audio, therefore, pitch and harmonics are
// are preserved. See audio_renderer_algorith.cc for a more elaborate
// description of the algorithm.
//
// Audio at very low or very high playback rates are muted to preserve quality.
