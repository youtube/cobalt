On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Test cursor rules which should accept 'hand' as an alias of 'pointer'.
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: hand;") is "cursor: pointer;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png), hand;") is "cursor: url(\"file:///foo.png\"), pointer;"


Test invalid cursor rules which shouldn't parse at all.
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png), url(file:///foo2.png);") is ""
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
