caption: Native application signing during Progressive Web Application installation
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset enables the use of ad-hoc signatures for the native application that is created when installing a Progressive Web Application (PWA). This ensures that each installed application has a unique identity to <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph> system components.

  Setting the policy to Disabled will result in every native application created when installing Progressive Web Applications having the same identity. This can interfere with <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph> functionality.

  Only turn off the policy if you are using an endpoint security solution that blocks applications with an ad-hoc signature.
