Description:
This directory contains a copy of the Polymer framework and some elements from
the Polymer elements catalog (https://elements.polymer-project.org/). See
v3_0/package.json for a full list of components.

The source git repositories can be found at:
https://github.com/Polymer/polymer

Polymer is comprised of two efforts:
1. A set of core platform features (Shadow DOM, Custom Elements, MDV).
Initially, these core features will be enabled with a set of polyfills. As
browsers begin to implement these new primitives, the polyfill platform layer
becomes smaller and better over time.
2. A next-generation web application framework built upon these core
technologies called the Polymer.

Local Modifications:
- Applied modifications that can be found in various v3_0/*.patch files.
- Removed executable bit from some files.
- Resolved encoding issues.
- Replaced CRLF line endings with LF line endings in text files.
- Removed files that are not needed by Chromium, see v3_0/rsync_exclude.txt.
- Re-implemented <paper-ripple> using Web Animations API (which, as of
  2/21/2017 does not work in Safari or IE). This is a complete fork from
  Polymer's <paper-ripple>.
- Removed CSS properties that are not needed in Chromium using
  css_strip_prefixes.py script.
- Bundled and minified Polymer 3 with minify_polymer.py, since Polymer 3 repo
  does not distribute minified files.
- Note that the Polymer 3 bundle does not include dir-mixin.js which is
  responsible for polyfylling :dir() CSS rules, because it causes a performance
  regression (and it is unnecessary), see crbug.com/899603 for more context.
- Applied workaround for explicit calls to attachShadow() at
  https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/5574#issuecomment-649854825 since
  that issue has not yet been fixed in the upstream repository.
- Several modifications were introduced in v3.5.0 to save size, by pruning out
  codepaths related to
  1) ShadyDOM support (not needed by Chromium since native ShadowDOM is used).
     Done by passing --define window.ShadyDOM=false flag to Terser.
  2) ShadyCSS support (not needed by Chromium since no CSS mixins are used).
     Done by passing --define window.ShadyCSS=false flag to Terser, as well as
     by exluding all imports of shadycss/, which effectively removes the
     shadycss polyfil from the final Polymer bundle.
  3) PolymerElement#updateStyles() was modified to not rely on the ShadyCSS
     polyfil anymore, and call the native this.style.setProperty() API instead
     (required after the changes in #1)
  4) PolymerElement#getComputedStyleValue() is now defunct (it was relying on
     ShadyCSS stuff), and the native HTMLElement#computedStyleMap() API should
     be used instead.
  5) Polymer codepaths guarded by flags to preserve legacy Polymer behavior.
     Specifically legacyWarnings, syncInitialRender, legacyUndefined,
     legacyNoObservedAttributes.
  6) Polymer codepaths guarded by flags implementing various
     new optimizations introduced to v3.5.0. Specifically
     removeNestedTemplates, fastDomIf, suppressTemplateNotifications,
     useAdoptedStyleSheetsWithBuiltCSS.
