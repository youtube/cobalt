caption: Enable mixed content autoupgrading on HTTPS sites
desc: |-
  Chrome will attempt to upgrade some types of mixed content (HTTP on an HTTPS site) subresources on iOS.
  See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/autoupgrade-mixed.md for details.

  The feature will be enabled by default. Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset will leave the feature enabled.

  Setting the policy to Disabled disables the feature.

  This policy is a temporary workaround and will be removed in a few milestones (the removal is tentatively planned to happen in M113).
