desc: |-
  If this policy is set all specified data types will be excluded from synchronization both for <ph name="CHROME_SYNC_NAME">Chrome Sync</ph> as well as for roaming profile synchronization. This can be beneficial to reduce the size of the roaming profile or limit the type of data uploaded to the <ph name="CHROME_SYNC_NAME">Chrome Sync</ph> Servers.

        The current data types for this policy are: "bookmarks", "readingList", "preferences", "passwords", "autofill", "themes", "typedUrls", "extensions", "apps", "tabs", "wifiConfigurations". Those names are case sensitive!
