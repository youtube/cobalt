You\u0027ve done it the best way that you can.\n\nWe have a new \"cascading _env.py\" mechanism for using the Python packaging system in our source tree, but it\u0027s not yet in the public repo.\n\nBut since we\u0027re here, it occurs to me that while this launcher does run tests locally, it doesn\u0027t run cross-compiled tests on another host.\n\nHave you tried/considered doing this?
