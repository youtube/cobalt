The .crx packages must be signed by WebStore in order for the extensions to
have the expected IDs which are allowlisted in Chrome.
The expected IDs are:
extension.crx:            oclffehlkdgibkainkilopaalpdobkan
in_session_extension.crx: ofcpkomnogjenhfajfjadjmjppbegnad

extension.crx is used in the API tests for the following APIs:
-chrome.loginScreenUi
-chrome.storage
-chrome.login

in_session_extension.crx is used in the API tests for the following APIs:
-chrome.login

The code for the tests can be found under the
chrome/browser/chromeos/extensions/login_screen_apis/ directory.

In case a new version of one of the test extension has to be published on
WebStore, please reach out to the OWNERS, chromeos-enterprise-extensions@ or
managed-devices@ mailing list.
