// This class is an autocomplete provider which provides URL results from

// The mechanism that makes it "fuzzy" is a trie search that tolerates errors
// and produces corrected inputs which can then be autocompleted as normal.
// Relevance penalties are applied for corrections as errors reduce confidence.
// The trie is built from history URL text and any text that can be formed
// by tracing a path from the root is said to be "on trie" while any text
// that escapes the trie with a character not present is said to be "off trie".
// If the autocomplete input is fully on trie, no suggestions are provided
// because exact matching should already provide the best results. If the
// autocomplete input is off trie, corrections of bounded size are produced
// to get the input back on trie, and these should then be eligible for
// autocompletion.
// The data structure could contain anything helpful, including ways to mark
// terminal nodes (signaling a path as a complete string). A relevance score
// could serve this purpose and make full independent autocompletion possible,
// but efficiency is a top concern so node size is minimized, just enough to
// get inputs back on track, not to replicate the full completion and scoring
// of other autocomplete providers.
