caption: Override Related Website Sets.
default: {}
desc: |-
  This policy provides a way to override the list of sets the browser uses for Related Website Sets features.

  This policy overrides the <ph name="FIRST_PARTY_SETS_OVERRIDES_POLICY_NAME">FirstPartySetsOverrides</ph> policy.

  Each set in the browser's list of Related Website Sets must meet the requirements of a Related Website Set.
  A Related Website Set must contain a primary site and one or more member sites.
  A set can also contain a list of service sites that it owns, as well as a map from a site to all of its ccTLD variants.
  See https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets for more information on how <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> uses Related Website Sets.


  All sites in a Related Website Set must be a registrable domain served over HTTPS. Each site in a Related Website Set must also be unique,
  meaning a site cannot be listed more than once in a Related Website Set.

  When this policy is given an empty dictionary, the browser uses the public list of Related Website Sets.

  For all sites in a Related Website Set from the <ph name="REPLACEMENTS">replacements</ph> list, if a site is also present
  on a Related Website Set in the browser's list, then that site will be removed from the browser's Related Website Set.
  After this, the policy's Related Website Set will be added to the browser's list of Related Website Sets.

  For all sites in a Related Website Set from the <ph name="ADDITIONS">additions</ph> list, if a site is also present
  on a Related Website Set in the browser's list, then the browser's Related Website Set will be updated so that the
  new Related Website Set can be added to the browser's list. After the browser's list has been updated,
  the policy's Related Website Set will be added to the browser's list of Related Website Sets.

  The browser's list of Related Website Sets requires that for all sites in its list, no site is in
  more than one set. This is also required for both the <ph name="REPLACEMENTS">replacements</ph> list
  and the <ph name="ADDITIONS">additions</ph> list. Similarly, a site cannot be in both the
  <ph name="REPLACEMENTS">replacements</ph> list and the <ph name="ADDITIONS">additions</ph> list.

  Wildcards (*) are not supported as a policy value, nor within any Related Website Set in these lists.

  All sets provided by the policy must be valid Related Website Sets, if they aren't then an
  appropriate error will be outputted.
