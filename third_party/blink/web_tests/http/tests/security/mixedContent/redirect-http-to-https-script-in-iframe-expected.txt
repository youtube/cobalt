CONSOLE WARNING: Mixed Content: The page at 'https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-redirect-http-to-https-script.html' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script 'http://example.test:8080/security/resources/redir.php?url=https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/script.js'. This content should also be served over HTTPS.
This test loads a secure iframe that loads an insecure script (but with a tricky redirect). We should trigger a mixed content callback because an active network attacker could have redirected the script load to https://attacker.com.
