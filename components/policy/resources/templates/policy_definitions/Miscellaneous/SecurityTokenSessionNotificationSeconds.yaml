caption: Duration of the notification on smart card removal for <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google
  ChromeOS</ex></ph>.
desc: This policy only takes effect when the policy <ph name="SECURITY_TOKEN_SESSION_BEHAVIOR_POLICY_NAME">SecurityTokenSessionBehavior</ph>
  is set to <ph name="SECURITY_TOKEN_SESSION_BEHAVIOR_LOCK">LOCK</ph> or <ph name="SECURITY_TOKEN_SESSION_BEHAVIOR_LOGOUT">LOGOUT</ph>,
  and a user who authenticates via a smart card removes that smart card. Then, this
  policy specifies for how many seconds a notification which informs the user of the
  impending action is displayed. This notification is blocking the screen. The action
  will only happen after this notification expires. The user can prevent the action
  from happening by re-inserting the smart card before the notification expires. If
  this policy is set to zero, no notification will be displayed and the action happens
  immediately.
