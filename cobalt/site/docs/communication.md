# How to Communicate with the Cobalt Team

We have several communication channels that we actively support, each for
different purposes.

## Filing Bugs and Feature Requests

If you have identified a bug in Cobalt common code - meaning that you don't
expect that it is related to a platform or port implementation quirk, then you
should file a bug on our public issue tracker.

Additionally, if you have specific feature requests, you can also file them on
our public tracker, but they should be very concrete and well-specified. If
unsure, ask about your request on cobalt-dev first.

[View all Open Cobalt Bugs](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues?q=componentid:181120%20status:open)

*You will need a valid Google account to post. You can [create a Google
account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail) with a non-gmail
address (say, your work email address).*

We also encourage contributions by sending pull requests on Github, especially
if the bugfix or feature addition is small, well tested, and [follows
our contribution guidelines](https://github.com/youtube/cobalt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Asking about Schedules, Discussing Features, Announcements, and Miscellany

We also have a dedicated mailing list, cobalt-dev@googlegroups.com. If you are
spending time with Cobalt, you may want to subscribe. And if you have a concern
that doesn't fit into the above categories, asking about it on cobalt-dev is a
reasonable course of action.

Use this mailing list for asking related technical questions about Starboard or
Cobalt. We encourage searching through archives both in mailing list and bug
tracker for prior questions.

If your issue seems like a bug or is really a feature request, use the Issue
Tracker to file it.

## YouTube Topics

If you are using Cobalt for YouTube on your device, and have YouTube-specific
questions, you should contact your YouTube technical account manager
directly. The above forums are Cobalt-specific, but not YouTube-specific.  The
Cobalt engineering team can't speak on behalf of Google or YouTube.
