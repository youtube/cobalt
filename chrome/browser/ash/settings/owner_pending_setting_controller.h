// An extra layer on top of CrosSettings / OwnerSettingsService that allows for
// writing a setting before ownership is taken.
//
// Ordinarily, the OwnerSettingsService interface is used for writing settings,
// and the CrosSettings interface is used for reading them - but as the OSS
// cannot be used until the device has an owner, this class can be used instead,
// since writing the new value with SetEnabled works even before ownership is
// taken.
//
// If OSS is ready then the new value is written straight away, and if not, then
// a pending write is queued that is completed as soon as the OSS is ready.
// This write will complete even if Chrome is restarted in the meantime.
// The caller need not care whether the write was immediate or pending, as long
// as they also use this class to read the value of the device pref.
// IsEnabled will return the pending value until ownership is taken and the
// pending value is written - from then on it will return the signed, stored
// value from CrosSettings.
