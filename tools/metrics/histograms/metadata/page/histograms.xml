    Records the time from frame navigation start to FirstContentfulPaint of each

    metric is still useful in aggregate.

    Recorded for all ad frames with non-zero bytes or cpu usage that receive a
    FirstContentfulPaint. Recorded when the ad frame or page is destroyed.

    Changes to how cross-origin content is loaded (e.g., security policies,

    Measures the cumulative layout shift score (bit.ly/lsm-explainer) that has

    Records the count of 'causes' of LCP image load timings being less than
    document Time-To-First-Byte(TTFB) to diagnose crbug.com/1431906. This is
    recorded at most once per image, only when the image's load start was
    recorded as being before its associated document's TTFB. Recorded in the
    page load tracker when the LCP candidate changes. Unexplained instances are
    recorded in the 'Unknown' bucket, and these are expected to diminish over
    time as additional causes are uncovered.

  <summary>
    Measures the time from navigation timing's navigation start to the time the
    largest content (text or image) is first painted, across all frames.
    Excludes any content painted after user input. Includes content that has
    been removed from the page. See web.dev/lcp for more details.

    The value is recorded at the end of each page load or the latest time when
    we can reliably record: when the page is navigated away, the browser is
    closed, or on Android when the browser is backgrounded.

    Measures the time from navigation timing's navigation start to the time the
    largest content (text or image) is first painted, across all frames.
    Recorded at the point when a page which has been opened in the foreground is
    moved to the background for the first time. Excludes any content painted
    after user input. Includes content that has been removed from the page. See
    web.dev/lcp for more details.

    This metric is trying to record the LCP values which are not able to be
    recorded in PageLoad.PaintTiming.NavigationToLargestContentfulPaint2 for
    some reasons.
