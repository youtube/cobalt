This directory contains test data for //chrome/common/safe_browsing unit tests
on Mac OS X. The compiled binaries are checked in because the tests check
specific values in the load commands, which will change on being recompiled.

In the event that the tests need to evolve, a Makefile is provided to recreate
the binaries. Note that recompiling or re-code-signing the binaries will
require updating the test's assertions.

In June 2018, the code signing certificate was regenerated because codesign was
no longer accepting the long-expired certificate. Not all artifacts were re-
signed, though.

Note that the executable bit has been removed from all of executable files,
since they do not have a common extension (for checkperms.py) and they are
only ever treated as data.

The `executableppc' file has no Makefile target, as modern Macs cannot build
for PPC. This file was created in a 10.6 VM with Xcode 3.2.6.

Creating the signed binaries requires importing a temporary codesigning
identity into the current user's keychain. This is because the `codesign -k`
flag, which specifies a specific keychain file to use, is no longer respected.
The temporary identity will be removed after the test binary is signed.
