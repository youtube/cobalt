# OS DEFINITIONS
# =============================================================================
#
# We set these various is_FOO booleans for convenience in writing OS-based
# conditions.
#
# - is_android, is_chromeos, is_ios, and is_win should be obvious.
# - is_mac is set only for desktop Mac. It is not set on iOS.
# - is_posix is true for mac and any Unix-like system (basically everything
#   except Fuchsia and Windows).
# - is_linux is true for desktop Linux, but not for ChromeOS nor Android (which
#   is generally too different despite being based on the Linux kernel).
#
# Do not add more is_* variants here for random lesser-used Unix systems like
# aix or one of the BSDs. If you need to check these, just check the
# current_os value directly.
