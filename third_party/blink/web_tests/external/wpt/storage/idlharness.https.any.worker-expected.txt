[FAIL] StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface object
  assert_equals: prototype of self's property "StorageManager" is not Function.prototype expected function "function () { [native code] }" but got function "function EventTarget() { [native code] }"
[PASS] StorageManager interface object length
[PASS] StorageManager interface object name
[FAIL] StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
  assert_equals: prototype of StorageManager.prototype is not Object.prototype expected object "[object Object]" but got object "[object EventTarget]"
[PASS] StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
[PASS] StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
[PASS] StorageManager interface: operation persisted()
[PASS] StorageManager interface: member persist
[PASS] StorageManager interface: operation estimate()
[PASS] StorageManager must be primary interface of navigator.storage
[PASS] Stringification of navigator.storage
[PASS] StorageManager interface: navigator.storage must inherit property "persisted()" with the proper type
[PASS] StorageManager interface: navigator.storage must not have property "persist"
[PASS] StorageManager interface: navigator.storage must inherit property "estimate()" with the proper type
[PASS] WorkerNavigator interface: attribute storage
[PASS] WorkerNavigator interface: navigator must inherit property "storage" with the proper type
Harness: the test ran to completion.
