  <summary>
    Records the signals used to decide whether to unblock cookie access (in the
    network service) via the Storage Access API. This metric is recorded each
    time CookieSettings are queried and the Storage Access API is relevant (i.e.
    third-party cookies are blocked by user setting, and there's no
    site-specific override that takes precedence). This is recorded regardless
    of whether the Storage Access API is enabled in the browser.

    This metric is only recorded in the network service, not in the browser's
    CookieSettings object, since the browser's accesses supply hardcoded
    override signals and therefore are not interesting to analyze.
