caption: Automatically grant permission to these sites to connect to USB devices with
  the given vendor and product IDs on the login screen.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets you list the URL patterns that specify which sites are automatically granted permission to access a USB device with the given vendor and product IDs on the login screen. Each item in the list requires both <ph name="DEVICES_FIELD_NAME">devices</ph> and <ph name="URLS_FIELD_NAME">urls</ph> fields for the policy to be valid. Each item in the <ph name="DEVICES_FIELD_NAME">devices</ph> field can have a <ph name="VENDOR_ID_FIELD_NAME">vendor_id</ph> and <ph name="PRODUCT_ID_FIELD_NAME">product_id</ph> field. Omitting the <ph name="VENDOR_ID_FIELD_NAME">vendor_id</ph> field will create a policy matching any device. Omitting the <ph name="PRODUCT_ID_FIELD_NAME">product_id</ph> field will create a policy matching any device with the given vendor ID. A policy which has a <ph name="PRODUCT_ID_FIELD_NAME">product_id</ph> field without a <ph name="VENDOR_ID_FIELD_NAME">vendor_id</ph> field is invalid.

        The USB permission model will grant the specified URL permission to access the USB device as a top-level origin. If embedded frames need to access USB devices, the 'usb' <ph name="FEATURE_POLICY_HEADER_NAME">feature-policy</ph> header should be used to grant access. The URL must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored.

        Deprecated: The USB permission model used to support specifying both the requesting and embedding URLs. This is deprecated and only supported for backwards compatibility in this manner: if both a requesting and embedding URL is specified, then the embedding URL will be granted the permission as top-level origin and the requesting URL will be ignored entirely.

        Leaving the policy unset puts the global default value in use for all sites (no automatic access).
