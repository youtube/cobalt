caption: URLs where AutoOpenFileTypes can apply
desc: |-
  List of URLs specifying which urls <ph name="AUTO_OPEN_FILE_TYPES_POLICY_NAME">AutoOpenFileTypes</ph> will apply to. This policy has no impact on automatically open values set by users.

        If this policy is set, files will only automatically open by policy if the url is part of this set and the file type is listed in <ph name="AUTO_OPEN_FILE_TYPES_POLICY_NAME">AutoOpenFileTypes</ph>. If either condition is false the download won't automatically open by policy.

        If this policy isn't set, all downloads where the file type is in <ph name="AUTO_OPEN_FILE_TYPES_POLICY_NAME">AutoOpenFileTypes</ph> will automatically open.

        A URL pattern has to be formatted according to https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format.
