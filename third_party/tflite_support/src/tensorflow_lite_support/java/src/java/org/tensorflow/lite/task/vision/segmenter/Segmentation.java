     * Creates a {@link Segmentation} object.
     *
     * <p>{@link Segmentation} provides two types of outputs as indicated through {@link
     * OutputType}:
     *
     * <p>{@link OutputType#CATEGORY_MASK}: the result contains a single category mask, which is a
     * grayscale {@link TensorImage} with shape (height, width), in row major order. The value of
     * each pixel in this mask represents the class to which the pixel in the mask belongs. The
     * pixel values are in 1:1 corresponding with the colored labels, i.e. a pixel with value {@code
     * i} is associated with {@code coloredLabels.get(i)}.
     *
     * <p>{@link OutputType#CONFIDENCE_MASK}: the result contains a list of confidence masks, which
     * are in 1:1 correspondance with the colored labels, i.e. {@link masks.get(i)} is associated
     * with
     * {@code coloredLabels.get(i)}. Each confidence mask is a grayscale {@link TensorImage} with
     * shape (height, width), in row major order. The value of each pixel in these masks represents
     * the confidence score for this particular class.
     *
     * <p>IMPORTANT: segmentation masks are not direcly suited for display, in particular:<br>
     * \* they are relative to the unrotated input frame, i.e. *not* taking into account the {@code
     * Orientation} flag of the input FrameBuffer, <br>
     * \* their dimensions are intrinsic to the model, i.e. *not* dependent on the input FrameBuffer
     * dimensions.
     *
     * <p>Example of such post-processing, assuming: <br>
     * \* an input FrameBuffer with width=640, height=480, orientation=kLeftBottom (i.e. the image
     * will be rotated 90° clockwise during preprocessing to make it "upright"), <br>
     * \* a model outputting masks of size 224x224. <br>
     * In order to be directly displayable on top of the input image assumed to be displayed *with*
     * the {@code Orientation} flag taken into account (according to the <a
     * href="http://jpegclub.org/exif_orientation.html">EXIF specification</a>), the masks need to
     * be: re-scaled to 640 x 480, then rotated 90° clockwise.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code masks} and {@code coloredLabels} do not match the
     *     {@code outputType}
