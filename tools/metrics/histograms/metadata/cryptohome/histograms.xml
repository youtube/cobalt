    Records the result of the backup VaultKeyset cleanup for users with mixed

    the particular user is completed. Starting with M115 backup keyset for the
    migrated credential is removed after the successful authentication with the
    given credential with USS, even if the USS migration is not completed. This

    The amount of time cryptohome spends writing the USS container flatbuffer to
    persistent storage. This metric records the time UserSecretStash::Persist()
    takes to complete. The metric is emitted when a user adds, removes or
    updates a means of authentication or AuthFactor. Manipulating an AuthFactor
    requires UserSecretStash to write to the corresponding USS file.

    Background context on this histogram: A CryptohomeError in this context
    refers to an error that occurred in response to a dbus request to selected
    cryptohomed APIs. The set of APIs with this CryptohomeError is generally
    those related to authentication, and contains CryptohomeErrorInfo field in
    the dbus Reply protobuf. Currently that includes methods that are called
    during login. A CryptohomeError consists of a linear stack of
    ErrorLocations, each one of them is an actual line in the cryptohomed
    codebase which the error passed through, and could have certain attributes,
    known as ErrorAction attached to them. The ErrorLocation in the bottom of
    the stack could optionally have a TPM Error Code associated, if the source
    of error is TPM related.

    For this histogram, for every CryptohomeError that occurs, we individually
    report each individual ErrorLocation's corresponding enum value when an
    error ocurred.

    This histogram is also separated into several error buckets. The most
    standard error bucket is 'Error', which collects the errors populated in
    dbus responses. Other buckets are errors we collect in some subrountines,
    like migration. Migration errors are not surfaced to dbus responses, but
    silently fail instead. We collect those errors in separate buckets.

    This is useful to cryptohome developers in the sense that they'll be able to
    know which lines that handle error in cryptohomed has been triggered due to
    an error.

    For this histogram, for every CryptohomeError, we individually report all
    ErrorLocation that has the kDevCheckUnexpectedState ErrorAction associated
    with it. The kDevCheckUnexpectedState ErrorAction is used by developers when
    the developer believes that this error should never occur, so from a
    notification standpoint, it functions similar to a DCHECK(), except it never
    crashes cryptohome and handles the error in a graceful manner.

    This histogram is also separated into several error buckets. The most

    This is useful to cryptohome developers because they'll be alerted when any
    of the situations that the developers doesn't expect to occur occurs.

    For this histogram, we take the entire CryptohomeError's linear stack of

    This is useful to cryptohome developers because we're able to classify the
    CryptohomeError by the content of the stack, and identify new ways the error
    can occur if they do occur.

    For this histogram, for every CryptohomeError that occurred, we report the
    last ErrorLocation that does not have a TPM Error Code associated, and
    optionally the last ErrorLoctaion that have a TPM Error Code associated if
    one exist. The upper and lower 16-bit value of the reported value contains
    the last ErrorLocation that does not have a TPM Error Code associated and
    the TPM Error Code, correspondingly. If the CryptohomeError doesn't have a
    TPM Error Code associated, we report only the last ErrorLocation in the
    upper 16-bit value of the reported value, with zero for the other 16-bit. In
    addition, we might also report success values in this histogram. Success
    values map to zero.

    This histogram is also separated into several error buckets. The most

    This is useful to cryptohome developers because frequently, the last and
    second last ErrorLocation in the stack would be able to uniquely identify
    the error, and this histogram doesn't involve hashing, so it would be more
    convenient for the developers.
