Description:
xmllite is a minimalistic library for parsing and generating XML. Initially it
was a part of libjingle, which was used in chromium in the past. xmllite is the
only part of libjingle still being used in chromium, particularly in
//remoting.

Nothing outside Chromium uses this copy. If code in this directory is found to
be unused in Chromium, it's OK to delete it.

The targets are restricted to current consumers. People considering whether
to add new consumers should consider if they want to take over maintenance
of the library.

Local Modifications:
This code does not exist in an upstream repo anymore.
