deprecated: true
default: null
desc: |-
  This policy controls a label used to identify a signed in profile. This label will be shown in various locations to help users identify the profile such as next to the toolbar profile icon.
  This label will also be used as a default name for newly created profiles that can be modified by the users.

  If this policy is left unset the default label, either "Work" or "School" will be used.

  If this policy is set to "Label the profile as Work (0)", the "Work" label will be used.

  If this policy is set to "Label the profile as School (1)", the "School" label will be used.

  This policy will be overridden by the <ph name="CUSTOM_PROFILE_LABEL_POLICY_NAME">CustomProfileLabel</ph> policy if that policy is set.
