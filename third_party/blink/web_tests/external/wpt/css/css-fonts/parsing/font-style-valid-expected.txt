This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] e.style['font-style'] = "oblique 0deg" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "normal" but got "oblique 0deg"
[FAIL] e.style['font-style'] = "oblique 14deg" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "oblique" but got "oblique 14deg"
[FAIL] e.style['font-style'] = "oblique calc(100deg)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "oblique calc(100deg)" but got "oblique 90deg"
[FAIL] e.style['font-style'] = "oblique calc(-100deg)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "oblique calc(-100deg)" but got "oblique -90deg"
[FAIL] e.style['font-style'] = "oblique calc(30deg + (sign(2cqw - 10px) * 5deg))" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "oblique calc(30deg + (5deg * sign(2cqw - 10px)))" but got "oblique calc(30deg + sign(2cqw - 10px) * 5deg)"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
