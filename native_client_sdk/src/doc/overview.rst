**Native Client** (NaCl) is an open-source technology for running native
compiled code in the browser, with the goal of maintaining the portability
and safety that users expect from web applications. Native Client expands web
programming beyond JavaScript, enabling you to enhance your web applications
using your preferred language. This document describes some of the key benefits
and common use cases of Native Client.

Google has implemented the open-source `Native Client project
<http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient>`_ in the Chrome browser on Windows, Mac,
Linux, and Chrome OS. The :doc:`Native Client Software Development Kit (SDK)
<sdk/download>`, itself an open-source project, lets you create web applications
that use NaCl and run in Chrome across multiple platforms.

A Native Client web application consists of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a NaCl
module written in a language supported by the SDK. The NaCl SDK currently
supports C and C++; as compilers for additional languages are developed, the SDK
will be updated.

Native Client comes in two flavors: traditional (NaCl) and portable (PNaCl).
Traditional, which must be distributed through the Chrome Web Store lets you
target a specific hardware platform. Portable can run on the open web. A
bitcode file that can be loaded from any web server is downloaded to a client
machine and converted to hardware-specific code before any execution. For
details, see :doc:`NaCl and PNaCl </nacl-and-pnacl>`.

.. _why-use-native-client:

Why use Native Client?
======================

Native Client open-source technology is designed to run compiled code
securely inside a browser at near-native speeds. Native Client gives web
applications some advantages of desktop software. Specifically, it provides the
means to fully harness the client's computational resources for applications
such as:

- 3D games
- multimedia editors
- CAD modeling
- client-side data analytics
- interactive simulations.

Native Client gives C and C++ (and other languages targeting it) the same level
of portability and safety as JavaScript.

.. _benefits-of-native-client:

Benefits of Native Client
=========================

Benefits of Native Client include:

* **Graphics, audio, and much more:** Running native code modules that render 2D
  and 3D graphics, play audio, respond to mouse and keyboard events, run on
  multiple threads, and access memory directly---all without requiring the user
  to install a plug-in.
* **Portability:** Writing your applications once and running them on multiple
  operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac, and Chrome OS) and CPU architectures
  (x86 and ARM).
* **Easy migration path to the web:** Leveraging years of work in existing
  desktop applications. Native Client makes the transition from the desktop to 
  a web application significantly easier because it supports C and C++.
* **Security:** Protecting the user's system from malicious or buggy
  applications through Native Client's double sandbox model. This model offers
  the safety of traditional web applications without sacrificing performance
  and without requiring users to install a plug-in.
* **Performance:** Running at speeds within 5% to 15% of a native desktop
  application. Native Client also allows applications to harness all available
  CPU cores via a threading API. This enables demanding applications such as
  console-quality games to run inside the browser.

.. _common-use-cases:
  
Common use cases
================

Typical use cases for Native Client include the following:

* **Existing software components:** Native Client lets you repurpose existing
  C and C++ software in web applications. You don't need to rewrite and debug
  code that already works. It also lets your application take advantage of
  things the browser does well such as handling user interaction and processing
  events. You can also take advantage of the latest developments in HTML5.
* **Legacy desktop applications:** Native Client provides a smooth migration
  path from desktop applications to the web. You can port and recompile existing
  code for the computation engine of your application directly to Native Client,
  and need rebuild only the user interface and event handling portions for the
  browser. 
* **Heavy computation in enterprise applications:** Native Client can handle the
  number crunching required by large-scale enterprise applications. To ensure
  protection of user data, Native Client lets you run complex cryptographic
  algorithms directly in the browser so that unencrypted data never goes out
  over the network.
* **Multimedia applications:** Codecs for processing sounds, images, and movies
  can be added to the browser in a Native Client module.
* **Games:** Native Client lets web applications run at close to native
  speed, reuse existing multithreaded/multicore C/C++ code bases, and
  access low-latency audio, networking APIs, and OpenGL ES with programmable
  shaders. Native Client is a natural fit for running a physics engine or
  artificial intelligence module that powers a sophisticated web game.
  Native Client also enables applications to run unchanged across
  many platforms.
* **Any application that requires acceleration:** Native Client fits seamlessly
  into web applications. It's up to you to decide to what extent to use it.
  Use of Native Client covers the full spectrum from complete applications to
  small optimized routines that accelerate vital parts of web applications.

How Native Client works
=======================

Native Client is an umbrella name for a set of related software components for
developing C/C++ applications and running them securely on the web. At a high
level, Native Client consists of:

* **Toolchains:** collections of development tools (compilers, linkers, etc.)
  that transform C/C++ code to Portable Native Client modules or Native Client
  modules.
* **Runtime components:** components embedded in the browser or other host
  platforms that allow execution of Native Client modules securely and
  efficiently. 

The following diagram shows how these components interact:

.. figure:: /images/nacl-pnacl-component-diagram.png
   :alt: The Native Client toolchains and their outputs
   
   The Native Client toolchains and their outputs

.. _toolchains:

Toolchains
----------

A Native Client toolchain consists of a compiler, a linker, an assembler and
other tools that are used to convert C/C++ source code into a module that is
loadable by a browser.

The Native Client SDK provides two toolchains:

* The left side of the diagram shows **Portable Native Client** (PNaCl,
  pronounced "pinnacle"). An LLVM based toolchain produces a single, portable
  (**pexe**) module. At runtime an ahead-of-time (AOT) translator, built into
  the browser, translates the pexe into native code for the relevant client
  architecture.

* The right side of the diagram shows **(non-portable) Native Client**. A GCC
  based toolchain produces multiple architecture-dependent (**nexe**) modules,
  which are packaged into an application. At runtime the browser determines
  which nexe to load based on the architecture of the client machine.

The PNaCl toolchain is recommended for most applications. The NaCl-GCC
toolchain should only be used for applications that won't be distributed on the
open web.

.. _security:

Security
--------

Since Native Client permits the execution of native code on client machines,
special security measures have to be implemented:

* The NaCl sandbox ensures that code accesses system resources only through
  safe, whitelisted APIs, and operates within its limits without  attempting to
  interfere with other code running either within the browser or outside it.
* The NaCl validator statically analyzes code before running it to make sure it
  only uses code and data patterns that are permitted and safe.

These security measures are in addition to the existing sandbox in the
Chrome browser. The Native Client module always executes in a process with
restricted permissions. The only interaction between this process and the
outside world is through defined browser interfaces. Because of the
combination of the NaCl sandbox and the Chrome sandbox, we say that
Native Client employs a **double sandbox** design.

.. _portability:

.. _link_for_pnacl_translator:

Portability
-----------

Portable Native Client (PNaCl, prounounced "pinnacle") employs state-of-the-art
compiler technology to compile C/C++ source code to a portable bitcode
executable (**pexe**). PNaCl bitcode is an OS- and architecture-independent
format that can be freely distributed on the web and :ref:`embedded in web
applications<link_nacl_in_web_apps>`.

The PNaCl translator is a component embedded in the Chrome browser; its task is
to run pexe modules. Internally, the translator compiles a pexe to a nexe
(described above), and then executes the nexe within the Native Client sandbox
as described above. The translator uses intelligent caching to avoid
re-compiling the pexe if it was previously compiled on the client's browser.

Native Client also supports the execution of nexe modules directly in the
browser. However, since nexes contain architecture-specific machine code, they
are not allowed to be distributed on the open web. They can only be used as part
of applications and extensions that are installed from the Chrome Web Store.

For more details on the difference between NaCl and PNaCl, see
:doc:`NaCl and PNaCl <nacl-and-pnacl>`.

.. _link_nacl_in_web_apps:

Structure of a web application
==============================

.. _application_files:

A Native Client application consists of a set of files:

* **HTML and CSS:** The HTML file tells the browser where to find the manifest
  (nmf file) through the embed tag.
  
  .. naclcode::
  
    <embed name="mygame" src="mygame.nmf" type="application/x-pnacl" />

* **Manifest:** The manifest identifies the module to load and specifies
  options. For example, "mygame.nmf" might look like this:

  .. naclcode::
  
    {...
      ...
      "url": "mygame.pexe",
    }

* **pexe (portable NaCl file):** A compiled Native Client module. It uses the
  :ref:`Pepper API <link_pepper>`, which provides a bridge to JavaScript and
  other browser resources.

Pepper plug-in API
------------------

The Pepper plug-in API (PPAPI), called **Pepper** for convenience, is an
open-source, cross-platform C/C++ API for web browser plug-ins. Pepper allows a 
C/C++ module to communicate with the hosting browser and to access system-level
functions in a safe and portable way. One of the security constraints in Native
Client is that modules cannot make OS-level calls. Pepper provides analogous
APIs that modules can use instead.

You can use the Pepper APIs to gain access to the full array of browser
capabilities, including:

* :doc:`Talking to the JavaScript code in your application
  <devguide/coding/message-system>` from the C++ code in your NaCl module.
* :doc:`Doing file I/O <devguide/coding/file-io>`.
* :doc:`Playing audio <devguide/coding/audio>`.
* :doc:`Rendering 3D graphics <devguide/coding/3D-graphics>`.

Pepper includes both a :doc:`C API </c-api>` and a :doc:`C++ API </cpp-api>`.
The C++ API is a set of bindings written on top of the C API. For additional
information about Pepper, see `Pepper Concepts 
<http://code.google.com/p/ppapi/wiki/Concepts>`_.
