[FAIL] ":has(:is(:has(*)))" should be a valid selector
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected ":has(:is(:has(*)))" but got ":has(:is())"
[FAIL] ":has(:where(:has(*)))" should be a valid selector
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected ":has(:where(:has(*)))" but got ":has(:where())"
