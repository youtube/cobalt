CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 17: Second load finished.
This test opens a window that loads a frame with a subframe which contains insecure css image. The subframe is refreshed after it loads. We should trigger a mixed content callback twice despite the fact that on a second load of the subframe a css cache might be used to fetch an image.
