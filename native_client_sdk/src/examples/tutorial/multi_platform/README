Multi-platform App
==================

Please see the online documentation here:

This example shows how to use the SDK build system to generate a Chrome App
with support for multi-platform zip files.

Starting with Chrome 28, the Chrome Web Store includes a feature called
**multi-platform zip files.** This feature lets you structure your application
directory and zip file in a way that reduces the size of the user download
package.  Here's how this feature works:

* You still include all the .nexe files in the zip file that you upload to
  the CWS, but you designate specific .nexe files (and other files if
  appropriate) for specific architectures.
* The Chrome Web Store re-packages your app, so that users only download
  the files that they need for their specific architecture.
