TODO
====
webapp2 is considered feature complete and well tested, but if you think
something is missing or is not working well, please describe it in our issue
tracker:

    http://code.google.com/p/webapp-improved/issues/list

We'd love to know if you found a bug or if something can be improved. We are
also interested in ideas for new webapp2_extras modules and more tests and
documentation.

Thanks!

The real TODO
-------------
- Add WSGI middleware:
  - sessions
  - auth


The webapp TODO
---------------
Here is a list of updates for webapp that could be gradually implemented in
future SDK releases, to make webapp more close to webapp2:

- Include a updated version of webob in the SDK, available through
  use_library(). As of June 15, 2011 the latest version is 1.0.7.
  Issues: #2788, #170 and #719 (no access to parsed body parameters with PUT
  request in webapp)

- Use webob.Response
  Issues: #200, #5030

- Use webob.exc for status code exceptions.
  Issues:

- Make RequestHandler dispatch the requested method, using a class method.
  Issues: #468

- Better URI Routing.
  Issues: #444 (routing based on hostnames), #843 (limitations to build URIs),
  #2398 (routing based on the URL scheme), #2636 and #5128 (unquote URL paths
  before matching them)

Other issues:

- Webob module bundled in App Engine SDK ignores charset and transfer
  encoding setting specified in a header part of each multipart field.
  Issues: #2749

- Sending cookies using webapp.
  Issues: #5030

- When the content-type is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and POST data
  is empty the content-type is dropped by Google appengine.
  Issues: #3426; **works in webapp/webapp2**

- Unable to read POST variables ONCE self.request.body is read
  Issues: #5118 **can't reproduce in webapp, works in webapp2**
