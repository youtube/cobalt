<histogram name="DiskCache.0.Error" enum="DiskCacheError"
    expires_after="2024-02-04">

  <owner>src/net/disk_cache/OWNERS</owner>
  <summary>
    Critical error ids. Reported each time the disk backed blockfile cache
    encounters an error or a critical error. Warning: this histogram was expired
    from Oct 2020 to Sep 2021; data may be missing.

<histogram name="DiskCache.0.TotalIOTimeRead" units="ms"
    expires_after="2024-02-20">
  <owner>jam@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>swarm-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The total time it takes to perform a read IO operation. This is emitted at
    each cache read, and measures from the IO thread to background thread,
    waiting for the disk read, and back to the IO thread.
  </summary>

<histogram name="DiskCache.0.TotalIOTimeWrite" units="ms"
    expires_after="2024-02-20">
  <owner>jam@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>swarm-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The total time it takes to perform a write IO operation. This is emitted at
    each cache read, and measures from the IO thread to background thread,
    optionally waiting for the disk write, and back to the IO thread.
