caption: Enable deprecated web platform features for a limited time
deprecated: true
desc: "Specify a list of deprecated web platform features to re-enable temporarily.\n\
  \n      This policy gives administrators the ability to re-enable deprecated web\
  \ platform features for a limited time. Features are identified by a string tag\
  \ and the features corresponding to the tags included in the list specified by this\
  \ policy will get re-enabled.\n\n      If this policy is left not set, or the list\
  \ is empty or does not match one of the supported string tags, all deprecated web\
  \ platform features will remain disabled.\n\n      While the policy itself is supported\
  \ on the above platforms, the feature it is enabling may be available on fewer platforms.\
  \ Not all deprecated Web Platform features can be re-enabled. Only the ones explicitly\
  \ listed below can be for a limited period of time, which is different per feature.\
  \ The general format of the string tag will be [DeprecatedFeatureName]_EffectiveUntil[yyyymmdd].\
  \ As reference, you can find the intent behind the Web Platform feature changes\
  \ at https://bit.ly/blinkintents.\n      "
