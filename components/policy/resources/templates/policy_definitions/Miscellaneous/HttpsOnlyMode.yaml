caption: Allow HTTPS-Only Mode to be enabled
default: allowed
desc: |-
  This policy controls whether users can enable HTTPS-Only Mode (Always Use Secure Connections) in Settings. HTTPS-Only Mode upgrades all navigations to HTTPS.
        If this setting is not set or set to allowed, users will be allowed to enable HTTPS-Only Mode.
        If this setting is set to disallowed, users will not be allowed to enable HTTPS-Only Mode.
        If this setting is set to force_enabled, HTTPS-Only Mode will be enabled and users will not be able to disable it.
        Force enabling HTTPS-Only Mode is supported from M112 onwards.

  The separate <ph name="HTTP_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">HttpAllowlist</ph> policy
  can be used to exempt specific hostnames or hostname patterns from being
  upgraded to HTTPS by this feature.
