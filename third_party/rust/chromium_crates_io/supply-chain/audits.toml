https://github.com/ia0/data-encoding/issues/75 was partially addressed via
`#[doc(hidden)]` added in https://github.com/ia0/data-encoding/pull/76, but the
original repro from issue #75 can still trigger Undefined Behavior through
public APIs exposed by the `data-encoding` crate (without using `unsafe`, and
without using APIs named something like `internal_field_do_not_use`).

Additionally, the discussion in
https://github.com/ia0/data-encoding/issues/124 leans toward `unsafe`
encapsulation at a crate level, requiring crate-**global** reasoning to
prove soundness of public crate APIs.  Specifically, the crate currently
has a internal function that can cause Undefined Behavior if the caller
doesn't uphold certain (implied, not explicitly documented) safety
requirements.  The fact that such function is not marked as `unsafe`
effectively means that safety audit can't terminate and use **local**
reasoning near `unsafe` expression boundaries.
