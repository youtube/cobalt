The Native Client team at Google has gone to exceptional measures to
make Native Client a secure system, including holding a public
security contest. This page archives information from that contest,
including the list of contest winners and the lineup of security
experts who served as judges.

Although the security contest has ended, the Native Client team
welcomes your continued involvement in the project. You can help by
submitting bugs and participating in the Native Client discussion
group.

Contest overview
================

The Native Client team held a contest in 2009 to test the security of
Native Client and help make the system more secure. Participants were
invited to discover security bugs in Native Client technology in order
to compete for cash prizes.

Here was the challenge put forth by the Native Client team:

  Do you think it is impossible to safely run untrusted x86 code on
  the web? Do you want a chance to impress a panel of some of the top
  security experts in the world? Then submit an exploit to the Native
  Client Security contest and you could also win cash prizes, not to
  mention bragging rights.

The contest judges evaluated exploits designed to defeat Native Client
security measures based on severity, scope, reliability, and
style. The winning teams and entries are listed below.

       mathematics and computing science degree. Both have uncovered
       major security flaws in ubiquitous Internet software, in terms
       of both exploitable bugs and weaknesses in system protection
       mechanisms. Both have spoken at numerous security conferences
       in recent years, including BlackHat, Ruxcon, KiwiCon, and
       Cansec West.
