  //////// Notes on why the code is architected like this:
  // A job contains many inputs which each need to be executed. A single
  // execution can take up to 1 second so that latency is multiplied by the size
  // of the job. While it is important for jobs to execute and finish decently
  // quickly, it is also important to be good stewards of the background message
  // loop which is using the same hardware thread as other operations in Chrome.
  //
  // Running all the inputs in a single background message pump could hang the
  // underlying background thread for quite a while. However, if we only send
  // one input for execution at a time then completion of the job is subject to
  // the latency from other tasks in Chrome. Both of those approaches would
  // allow us to only use the unique_ptr by passing ownership of the job between
  // threads, reducing the complexity of the code below.
  //
  // But because of the potential latency regression on either other Chrome
  // tasks or our job, we've taken the approach of making many task scheduling
  // requests at once. This will let the background task runner to figure the
  // best way to schedule everything sooner. It comes at the cost of a more
  // complex lifetime of the job, which is detailed below.

  //////// Notes on lifetimes:
  // As of this point, |on_each_done_callback| owns |on_complete_callback|
  // which owns the underlying |job| instance.
  //
  // Running |on_each_done_callback| (especially when the input is empty, see
  // below) may destroy |job|. That makes it tricky for the loop to check
  // whether to continue since we need to use some state that is not tied to the
  // lifetime of |job|. Therefore, as pretty as
  // `while (auto input = job->GetNextInput())` would be, a more traditional for
  // loop is used using simple counting. In the same way,
  // `for ( ; i < job->CountOfRemainingNonNullInputs(); )` doesn't work either,
  // since |job| will be destroyed when the loop does its last exit check.
  const size_t num_inputs = job->CountOfRemainingNonNullInputs();
  for (size_t i = 0; i < num_inputs; i++) {
    std::string input = *job->GetNextInput();
    ExecuteOnSingleInput(
        job->type(), input,
        base::BindOnce(
