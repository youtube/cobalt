// Detector is used to determine janks in the sequence of periodic samples that
// have a timestamp. It conceptually has the following phases:
//   * kWarmUp - at this stage, samples are ignored, assuming the app is just
//               activated or resumed.
//   * kRateDetection - at this stage, samples are collected to determine the
//                      prevailing or normal rate. Once enough samples are
//                      collected, rate is determined as 33% cut-off of sorted
//                      sample durations.
//   * kActive - at this stage each new sample is tested against detected normal
//               rate and in case timestamp offset of the sample is longer than
//               190% of the determined period than this is considered as a
//               jank.
// In case the next sample appears after a long interval this is not considered
// as a jank and detector switches to warm-up stage.
// Detector may work in fixed mode, activated by |SetPeriodFixed| call. In this
// mode detector skips kWarmUp and kRateDetection and always watches for janks.
