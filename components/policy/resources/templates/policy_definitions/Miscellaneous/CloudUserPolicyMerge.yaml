caption: Enables merging of user cloud policies into machine-level policies
default: false
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled allows policies associated with a managed account to be merged into machine-level policies.

  Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset prevents user-level cloud policies from being merged with policies from any other sources.

  Only policies originating from secure users can take precedence. A secure user is affiliated with the organization that manages their browser using <ph name="CHROME_ENTERPRISE_CORE_NAME">Chrome Enterprise Core</ph>. All other user-level policies will have default precedence.

  Policies that need to be merged also need to be set in either <ph name="POLICY_LIST_MULTIPLE_SOURCE_MERGE_LIST_POLICY_NAME">PolicyListMultipleSourceMergeList</ph> or <ph name="POLICY_DICTIONARY_MULTIPLE_SOURCE_MERGE_LIST_POLICY_NAME">PolicyDictionaryMultipleSourceMergeList</ph>. This policy will be ignored if neither of the two aforementioned policies is configured.
