<histogram name="DWA.InitSequence" enum="UmaInitSequence"

  <summary>
    Logged during DwaService initialization whether the init task or the initial
    log timer completed first. The expectation is the vast majority of the time,
    the init task should complete first. If metrics show otherwise, then it may
    indicate there's a bug in the DwaService init sequence and that it should be
    investigated.
