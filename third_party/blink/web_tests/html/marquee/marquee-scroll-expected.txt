Test for bug 15263: REGRESSION: scrolldelay=0 causes marquee not to display

The marquee below is defined with a scrollDelay value of zero and with the truespeed attribute assigned to an empty string. It should scroll until the text, "The marquee scroll test passed" is visible and left justified.

This test uses cyan characters to make the result image deterministic. (Otherwise, the result image changes depending on when the content_shell takes a snapshot.) In order to run this test manually, change the color to black.

The marquee scroll test passed
