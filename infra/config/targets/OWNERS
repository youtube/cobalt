# Presently, these files only generate .pyl files in
# //infra/config/generated/testing which are synced to //testing/buildbot, see
# comment for *.pyl owner in //testing/buildbot/OWNERS for reasoning here. In
# the future, when targets spec .json files are generated (which use definitions
# in these files), the output files will have owners established.
