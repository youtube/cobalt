caption: URL pattern Exceptions to tab discarding
desc: "This policy makes it so that any URL matching one or more of the patterns it\
  \ specifies (using the <ph name=\"URL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME\">URLBlocklist</ph>\
  \ filter format) will never be discarded by the browser.\n      This applies to\
  \ memory pressure and high efficiency mode discarding.\n      A discarded page is\
  \ unloaded and its resources fully reclaimed. The tab its associated with remains\
  \ in the tabstrip, but making it visible will trigger a full reload.\n      "
