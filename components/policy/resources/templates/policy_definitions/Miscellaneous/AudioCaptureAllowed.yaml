arc_support: For Android apps, this policy affects the microphone only. When this
  policy is set to true, the microphone is muted for all Android apps, with no exceptions.
caption: Allow or deny audio capture
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means that, with the exception of URLs set in the AudioCaptureAllowedUrls list, users get prompted for audio capture access.

        Setting the policy to Disabled turns off prompts, and audio capture is only available to URLs set in the AudioCaptureAllowedUrls list.

        Note: The policy affects all audio input (not just the built-in microphone).
