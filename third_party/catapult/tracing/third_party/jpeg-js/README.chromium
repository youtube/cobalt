Description:
Pure JS jpeg decoder.

Local Modifications:
Only included the decoder from lib/decoder.js, renamed as jpeg-js-decoder.js.
Did not incldue encoder as we do not need it yet. Replaced
`module.exports = decode`
with
`global.jpegDecode = decode`
since we do not use node-styled modules in catapult and that throws an error.
