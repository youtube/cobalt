This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS setLocalDescription() with valid answer should succeed
PASS setLocalDescription() with type answer and null sdp should use lastAnswer generated from createAnswer
PASS setLocalDescription() with answer not created by own createAnswer() should reject with InvalidModificationError
FAIL Calling setLocalDescription(answer) from stable state should reject with InvalidModificationError promise_rejects_dom: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set local answer sdp: Called in wrong state: stable" that is not a DOMException InvalidModificationError: property "code" is equal to 0, expected 13
FAIL Calling setLocalDescription(answer) from have-local-offer state should reject with InvalidModificationError promise_rejects_dom: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set local answer sdp: Called in wrong state: have-local-offer" that is not a DOMException InvalidModificationError: property "code" is equal to 0, expected 13
