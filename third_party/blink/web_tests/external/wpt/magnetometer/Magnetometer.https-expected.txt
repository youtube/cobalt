This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that onerror is sent when sensor is not supported.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that onerror is sent when permissions are not granted.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that onerror is send when start() call has failed.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that frequency is capped to allowed maximum.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that frequency is capped to the maximum supported frequency.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that frequency is limited to the minimum supported frequency.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that sensor cannot be constructed within iframe disallowed to use feature policy.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that sensor can be constructed within an iframe allowed to use feature policy.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that 'onreading' is called and sensor reading is valid.
PASS Magnetometer: sensor reading is correct.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that readings are all mapped to expectedReadings correctly.
PASS Magnetometer: sensor timestamp is updated when time passes.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that sensor can be successfully created and its states are correct.
PASS Magnetometer: no exception is thrown when calling start() on already started sensor.
PASS Magnetometer: no exception is thrown when calling stop() on already stopped sensor.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that fresh reading is fetched on start().
PASS Magnetometer: Losing visibility must cause readings to be suspended.
PASS Magnetometer: frequency hint works.
PASS Magnetometer: Readings delivered by shared platform sensor are immediately accessible to all sensors.
PASS Magnetometer: throw 'TypeError' if frequency is invalid.
PASS Magnetometer: sensor reading is correct when options.referenceFrame is 'screen'.
PASS Magnetometer: throw 'TypeError' if referenceFrame is not one of enumeration values.
