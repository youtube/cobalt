caption: Show a UI toggle to exclude a display in mirror mode.
default: false
desc: |-
  Setting this policy shows a new UI toggle under each display in display settings. Normal mirror mode turns all displays into one display, but the new toggle allows users to exclude one display from mirroring and appear as an extended display.

  If the policy is set to Enabled, the toggle will appear for each display to exclude it from mirror mode, and users can choose one to enable.

  If the policy is unset or Disabled, the toggle will be hidden.

  Note: This policy will only affect UI, and ChromeOS will keep the existing settings when UI is hidden.
