caption: Set location to store screen captures
desc: |-
  Sets the directory where Screen Captures (both screenshot and screen recordings) are being saved.
  If the policy is set as recommended, the value will be used by default, but user will be able to change it.
  Otherwise the user can't change it and the captures are always saved to the defined directory.

  The policy uses same format as <ph name="DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY_POLICY_NAME">DownloadDirectory</ph> policy
  The location could be set to either local filesystem or <ph name="GOOGLE_DRIVE_NAME">Google Drive</ph> (with '${google_drive}' prefix) or <ph name="MICROSOFT_ONE_DRIVE_NAME">Microsoft OneDrive</ph> (with '${microsoft_onedrive}' prefix).
  If the policy is set to empty string, it'll force the screen captures to be stored in the local "Downloads" directory.
  See a list of variables you can use ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables ).

  Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> uses the default "Downloads" directory to store screen captures, and users can change it.
