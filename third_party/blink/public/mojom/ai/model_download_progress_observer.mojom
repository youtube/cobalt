// The observer will receive the model download progress updates after its
// registration while the Mojo interface is connected. It won't be notified
// after the connection is terminated even if there is update. The receiver
// side should manage the lifetime properly. For example, it should only
// create the observer and register it when the feature relying on the on-
// device model is in used, and close the connection as soon as the task
// completes.
// Note that this is a passive observer that's not associated with the state
// of the model. The registration of the observer won't trigger the model
// download and the completion of model download won't remove the observer or
// close the connection.

  // There is no guarantee that it must be called at least once (e.g. if the
  // model has been fully downloaded in the other tab and is being installed).
  // See https://github.com/WICG/translation-api/issues/20 for the discussion
  // about possible future improvements.
