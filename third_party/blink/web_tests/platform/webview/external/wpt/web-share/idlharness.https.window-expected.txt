This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Navigator interface: operation share(optional ShareData)
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "share" missing
[FAIL] Navigator interface: operation canShare(optional ShareData)
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "canShare" missing
[FAIL] Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "share(optional ShareData)" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "share" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Navigator interface: calling share(optional ShareData) on navigator with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_inherits: property "share" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "canShare(optional ShareData)" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "canShare" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Navigator interface: calling canShare(optional ShareData) on navigator with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_inherits: property "canShare" not found in prototype chain
