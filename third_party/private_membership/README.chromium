Description:

Private Set Membership (PSM) is a cryptographic protocol that
allows users to privately query whether the user's identifier is a
member of a set of identifiers held by a server in a
privacy-preserving manner.

For privacy, the Private Set Membership protocol guarantees the
following:
- The server does not learn any information about the sensitive
portion of the user's queried identifier. In particular, this also
means that the server does not learn whether the queried
identifier was a member or not.
- The querying user learns no information about the set of
identifiers that are stored by the server beyond whether the
querying user's identifier is a member or not of the server-held
set of identifiers. In other words, the querying user learns the
bare minimum amount of information which is only the answer of the
membership query.
