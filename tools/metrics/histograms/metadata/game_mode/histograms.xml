    Records events of two types, when they occur. `Attempted` indicates game
    mode is entered. `Failed` indicates the previous attempt to enter game mode
    timed out or failed. They will only be recorded the first time we detect
    that game mode is entered/failed for each time that game mode is initially
    entered.

  <summary>
    Time spent in a fullscreen Borealis game. Recorded when leaving game mode
    (i.e. closing, un-fullscreening, or switching focus away from a game which
    the user is immersed in.)

    There are two purposes for this metric:

    For determining if there is a significant number of users spending little
    time in Game Mode. A significant number not in the top bucket would indicate
    we need hysteresis to avoid shutting down background tabs too early. This
    has a small granularity so we can determine the most effective cut-off
    point.
