/**
 * Base class for tasks which connects to Google Play Services using given GoogleApiClient,
 * performs action specified in doWhenConnected method, disconnects the client and cleans up
 * by invoking cleanUp method.
 *
 * <p>
 * Using the same client for tasks running in more than one thread is a serious error, as
 * the state can then be modified while other threads are still using the client. The
 * recommended way to use these tasks is with a {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor}
 * having a pool size of 1.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class waits {@link #CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS} milliseconds for connection to be established.
 * If connection is unsuccessful then it will retry after {@link #CONNECTION_RETRY_TIME_MS}
 * milliseconds as long as Google Play Services is available. Number of retries is limited to
 * {@link #RETRY_NUMBER_LIMIT}.
 * </p>
