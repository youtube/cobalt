caption: Connection types allowed for updates
desc: |2-
   The types of connections that are allowed to use for OS updates. OS updates potentially put heavy strain on the connection due to their size and may incur additional cost. Therefore, they are by default not enabled for connection types that are considered expensive (currently only "cellular").

        The recognized connection type identifiers are <ph name="CONNECTION_TYPE_ETHERNET_NAME">"ethernet"</ph>, <ph name="CONNECTION_TYPE_WIFI_NAME">"wifi"</ph>, and <ph name="CONNECTION_TYPE_CELLULAR_NAME">"cellular"</ph>.
