caption: Screen brightness percent
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies screen brightness percent, turning autobrightness features off. Initial screen brightness adjusts to the policy value, but users can change it.

        Leaving the policy unset doesn't affect user screen controls or autobrightness features.

        Note: The policy values should be specified in percents from 0 to 100.
