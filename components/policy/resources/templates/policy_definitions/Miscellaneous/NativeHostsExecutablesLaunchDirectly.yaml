caption: Force Windows executable Native Messaging hosts to launch directly
default: null
desc: |-
  This policy controls whether native host executables launch directly on Windows.

        Setting the policy to Enabled forces <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to launch native messaging hosts implemented as executables directly.

        Setting the policy to Disabled will result in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> launching hosts using cmd.exe as an intermediary process.

        Leaving the policy unset allows <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to decide which approach to use.
