// Nearby Connections uses this BluetoothSocket to communicate with a remote
// device. At a high-level, it first exchanges frames to encrypt the connection,
// then delegates to its caller (e.g., Nearby Share) to authenticate the
// connection, and finally expects its caller to send and receive
// application-level messages. The following precautions are taken to handle
// untrusted bytes received from remote devices:
//   * Nearby Connections (which this class is a piece of) is hosted in a
//     Nearby utility process.
//   * Whenever Nearby Connections provides bytes received from a remote device
//     to its caller, even after it has been authenticated, the caller must not
//     trust those bytes, and is responsible for first passing those bytes
//     through the trusted NearbyDecoder interface (see go/nearby-chrome-mojo).
//     NearbyDecoder is hosted in the same Nearby utility process.
//
// api::BluetoothSocket is a synchronous interface, so this implementation
// consumes the synchronous signatures of bluetooth::mojom::Socket methods.
