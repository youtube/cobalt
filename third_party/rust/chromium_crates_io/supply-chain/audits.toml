I grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bfs\b'`, `'\bnet\b'`, `'\bunsafe\b'`.

All `unsafe` in `flate2` is gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "any_zlib")]`:

* The code under `src/ffi/...` will not be used because the `mod c`
  declaration in `src/ffi/mod.rs` depends on the `any_zlib` config
* 7 uses of `unsafe` in `src/mem.rs` also all depend on the
  `any_zlib` config:
    - 2 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 2 in `fn set_level` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 3 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Decompress`)

All hits of `'\bfs\b'` are in comments, or example code, or test code
(but not in product code).

There were no hits of `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bnet\b'`.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.
