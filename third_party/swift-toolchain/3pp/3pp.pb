# TODO(crbug.com/1340013): Have a linux section for the toolchain for
# goma/reclient. It likely just needs to download the .tgz on swift.org and
# unpack it.

# IMPORTANT: When changing the download URL, also be sure to update the install
# directory in the `build` section. Otherwise the packaging bot will fail.

# IMPORTANT: When updating the version, you need to also update he version
# in //build/toolchain/apple/toolchain.gni so that all .swift modules are
# correctly considered dirty and built with the new version of the compiler.
