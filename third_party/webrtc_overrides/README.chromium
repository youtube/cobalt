Description:
This folder contains WebRTC files (third_party/webrtc) that should be
overridden. The reason for this folder to be separate from third_party/webrtc is
that WebRTC is pulled directly into third_party/webrtc and the overrides need to
be in the Chromium repo since they depend on Chromium code.

For information on WebRTC, see third_party/webrtc/README.chromium.

Third party code used in this project is described in the file
third_party/webrtc/LICENSE_THIRD_PARTY.
