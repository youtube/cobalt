caption: Allow Same Origin Tab capture by these origins
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets you set a list of URL patterns that can capture tabs with their same Origin.

        Leaving the policy unset means that sites will not be considered for an override at this level of capture.

        Note that windowed Chrome Apps with the same origin as this site will still be allowed to be captured.

        If a site matches a URL pattern in this policy, the following policies will not be considered: <ph name="TAB_CAPTURE_ALLOWED_BY_ORIGINS_POLICY_NAME">TabCaptureAllowedByOrigins</ph>, <ph name="WINDOW_CAPTURE_ALLOWED_BY_ORIGINS_POLICY_NAME">WindowCaptureAllowedByOrigins</ph>, <ph name="SCREEN_CAPTURE_ALLOWED_BY_ORIGINS_POLICY_NAME">ScreenCaptureAllowedByOrigins</ph>, <ph name="SCREEN_CAPTURE_ALLOWED_POLICY_NAME">ScreenCaptureAllowed</ph>.

        For detailed information on valid <ph name="URL_LABEL">url</ph> patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.  This policy only matches based on origin, so any path in the URL pattern is ignored.
