caption: Configure allowed app/extension types
desc: |-
  Setting the policy controls which apps and extensions may be installed in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>, which hosts they can interact with, and limits runtime access.

        Leaving the policy unset results in no restrictions on the acceptable extension and app types.

        Extensions and apps which have a type that's not on the list won't be installed. Each value should be one of these strings:

        * "extension"

        * "theme"

        * "user_script"

        * "hosted_app"

        * "legacy_packaged_app"

        * "platform_app"

        See the <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> extensions documentation for more information on these types.

        Versions earlier than 75 that use multiple comma separated extension IDs aren't supported and are skipped. The rest of the policy applies.

        Note: This policy also affects extensions and apps to be force-installed using <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_FORCELIST_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionInstallForcelist</ph>.
