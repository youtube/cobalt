// This class keeps track of running workers of all types for a single browser
// context and handles the ownership of the worker nodes.
//
// Most of the complexity of this class is tracking every worker's clients. Each
// type of worker handles them a bit differently.
//
// The simplest case is dedicated workers, where each worker always has exactly
// one frame client. Technically, it is possible to create a nested dedicated
// worker, but for now they are treated as child of the ancestor frame.
// TODO(1128645): Expose nested dedicated workers correctly.
//
// Shared workers are quite similar to dedicated workers but they can have any
// number of clients. Also, a shared worker can temporarily appear to have no
// clients shortly after being created and just before being destroyed.
//
// Service workers are more complicated to handle. They also can have any number
// of clients, but they aren't only frames. They could also be dedicated worker
// and shared worker clients. These different types of clients are tracked using
// the ServiceWorkerClient class. Also, because of the important role the
// service worker plays with frame navigations, the service worker can be
// created before its first client's navigation has committed to a
// RenderFrameHost. So when a OnControlleeAdded() notification is received for
// a client frame, it is necessary to wait until the RenderFrameHost was
// determined.
