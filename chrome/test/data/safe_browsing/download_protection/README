This directory contains some executable files for testing the SignatureUtil
implementations.  Instructions for regenerating these executables:

unsigned.exe:

cl /Feunsigned.exe simple_exe.cc

signed.exe:

MakeCert -sv test.pvk test.cer (password: "password")
Cert2SPC test.cer test.spc
pvk2pfx -pvk test.pvk test.cer (export the private key with the cert)
copy unsigned.exe signed.exe
signtool sign /f test.pfx /p password signed.exe

disable_outdated_build_detector.exe: Signed Google Chrome binary from an
official build.

signed_twice.exe: A copy of signed.exe with a bogus hand-crafted second
attribute certificate entry.

The various zipfile*.zip files, used by the SandboxedZipAnalyzerTest, were
generated with the following commands:
- zip zipfile_no_binaries.zip simple_exe.cc
- zip zipfile_one_unsigned_binary.zip unsigned.exe
- zip zipfile_two_binaries_one_signed.zip unsigned.exe signed.exe
- zip -e encrypted.zip signed.exe
- cp encrypted.zip encrypter_zip_no_extension
