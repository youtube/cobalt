linearized.pdf is a pdf test file that is:
1) linearized (what some pdf generating apps call "web optimized" or "Fast Web
   View")
and
2) big enough to trigger chunked/range http requests when rendering the pdf in
   the browser (and in browser tests :-).

linearized.pdf test file was generated around January 2020 with the
following cmdlines:
    $ find chromium/src/third_party/pdfium/core -name '*.h' -or -name '*.cc'
        | sort | grep -v -i drm | grep -v -i priv \
        | xargs enscript -Ecpp -o - \
        | ps2pdf - tmp.pdf
    $ qpdf --linearize tmp.pdf linearized.pdf
