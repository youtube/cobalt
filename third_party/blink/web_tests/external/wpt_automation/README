This folder is for Chrome automation specific only. If your manual test
can be automated using test_driver APIs exposed in wpt documented in
https://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/testdriver.html
use those APIs and drop the "manual" suffix from the name of the test.

If your test can only be automated with Chrome only testing APIs
such as eventSender then leave the "manual" in the name of the test
and add a mirror automation script in this directory. You need to also
make sure your test subdirectory is whitelisted under
resources/testharnessreport.js.

If you add an automation script here please also file an issue to capture
the follow up work with the owners in that space to make that testing API
cross browser.
