CONSOLE WARNING: Listener added for a 'DOMNodeInserted' mutation event. This event type is deprecated, and will be removed from this browser VERY soon. Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a large risk of imminent site breakage. Consider using MutationObserver instead. See https://chromestatus.com/feature/5083947249172480 for more information.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS  if the test wasn't terminated by an assertion.
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
