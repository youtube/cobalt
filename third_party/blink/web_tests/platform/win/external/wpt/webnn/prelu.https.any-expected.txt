This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] prelu float32 1D tensors / async
[FAIL] prelu float32 2D tensors / async
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."
[FAIL] prelu float32 3D tensors / async
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."
[FAIL] prelu float32 4D tensors / async
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."
[FAIL] prelu float32 5D tensors / async
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."
[PASS] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 1D slope / async
[FAIL] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 1D slope of shape [1] / async
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: The input and slope should have the same last dimension."
[FAIL] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 2D slope / async
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."
[PASS] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 3D slope / async
[FAIL] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 4D slope / async
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: The input and slope should have the same last dimension."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
