    Exportable commits contain changes in the wpt directory and have not been
    exported (no corresponding closed PRs on GitHub). Commits made by importer
    are ignored. Exportable commits may or may not apply cleanly against the
    wpt HEAD (see argument require_clean).

    Args:
        host: A Host object.
        local_wpt: A LocalWPT instance, used to see whether a Chromium commit
            can be applied cleanly in the upstream repo.
        wpt_github: A WPTGitHub instance, used to check whether PRs are closed.
        number: The number of commits back to look. The commits to check will
            include all commits starting from the commit before HEAD~n, up
            to and including HEAD.
        require_clean: Whether to only return exportable commits that can be
            applied cleanly and produce non-empty diff when tested individually.
        verify_merged_pr: Whether to verify merged PRs can be found in the local
            WPT repo. If this argument is True, for each Chromium commit with a
            corresponding merged PR, we also check the local WPT repo, and still
            consider the commit exportable if it cannot be found in local WPT.
            (Note: Chromium commits that have closed but not merged PRs are
            always considered exported regardless of this argument.)

    Returns:
        (exportable_commits, errors) where exportable_commits is a list of
        ChromiumCommit objects for exportable commits in the given window, and
        errors is a list of error messages when exportable commits fail to apply
        cleanly, both in chronological order.
