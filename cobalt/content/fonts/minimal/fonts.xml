    Fallback fonts are chosen based on a match: full BCP-47 language tag
    including script, then just language, and finally order (the first font
    containing the glyph). Order of appearance is also the tiebreaker for weight
    matching.

    NOTE: When the optional family attribute "fallback" is included for a
    family, then it dictates whether or not that family is added to the fallback
    list. However, when it is not included, then the lack of a "name" attribute
    causes the family to be added to the fallback list.

    The optional family attribute "pages" indicates which character pages are
    contained within the family. It is used with character fallback to allow the
    system to quickly determine that a character cannot appear in a font without
    requiring the full character map to be loaded into memory. Character pages
    are zero indexed, and each page contains 256 characters, so character 1000
    would be contained within page 3.

    The optional font attribute "disable_synthetic_bolding" prevents the font
    from being synthetically bolded. By default synthetic bolding is done when
    there is no bold font available and a bold weight (>500) is specified.
