caption: Force downloading of Office documents (e.g. .docx) instead of opening them in the <ph name="BASIC_EDITOR_NAME">Basic Editor</ph>
default: true
default_for_enterprise_users: false
desc: |-
  When enabled, this policy forces navigations to any Office documents with a MIME type normally handled by the <ph name="BASIC_EDITOR_NAME">Basic Editor</ph> to download the file.

  If the policy is disabled then these documents will instead be automatically opened in the <ph name="BASIC_EDITOR_NAME">Basic Editor</ph>.

  Leaving this policy unset for regular users is functionally equivalent to it being enabled (i.e. files will be downloaded); leaving the policy unset for enterprise users is functionally equivalent to it being disabled (i.e. files will be opened in the <ph name="BASIC_EDITOR_NAME">Basic Editor</ph>).
