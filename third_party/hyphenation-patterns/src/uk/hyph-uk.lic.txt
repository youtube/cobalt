%         Hyphenation patterns for Ukrainian in T2A and UTF-8 encodings.
%         For 8-bit engines, the 'ukrhyph' package provides a number of
%         different pattern sets, as well as different (8-bit) encodings, that
%         can be chosen at format-generation time.  The UTF-8 version only
%         provides the default pattern set.  A mechanism similar to the one used
%         for 8-bit patterns may be implemented in the future.
