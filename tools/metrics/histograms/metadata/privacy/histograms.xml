    Records the relationship between profile and client eligibility for 3PCD

    All profiles on the same client share a single eligibility value for
    experiment purposes, but it is possible that an individual profile on the
    client has a different eligibility than the client value used. This

    client is part of the experiment and the profile is not guest or incognito).

    The metrics records `kSet` if the `Sec-Cookie-Deprecation` header is added
    to the request. It records `kNoLabel` if there is no label available. This
    happens when the client is ineligible to the experiment or when the label
    value configured in the experiment is empty &quot;&quot; It records
    `kNoCookie` if there is a label available but the opt-in cookie is not

    The number of sites that may have had their storage cleared by DIPS.

    If DIPS deletion is on, third-party cookies are blocked, and there are no
    url-specific exemptions by the user for the latter, then, this is the number
    of sites that have had storage cleared by DIPS. Otherwise, this number is
    the sites that would've had their storage cleared if the above conditions
    were met for all the sites.

    This is recorded every time the DIPS timer is fired, which is determined by
    the `timer_delay` parameter of the DIPS feature.

    This is only logged for site-data clearing that occurs as a result of DIPS.
    If a site contributes to this count then it has performed a potential
    tracking action (e.g. writing to storage, bouncing the user, or both)
    without the user interacting with that site before, or soon after, the
    action.
