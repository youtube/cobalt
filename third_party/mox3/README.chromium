Description:
Mox3 is an unofficial port of the Google mox framework
(http://code.google.com/p/pymox/) to Python 3. It was meant to be as compatible
with mox as possible, but small enhancements have been made. The library was
tested on Python version 3.2, 2.7 and 2.6.

This library is added since pyfakefs depends on it.
