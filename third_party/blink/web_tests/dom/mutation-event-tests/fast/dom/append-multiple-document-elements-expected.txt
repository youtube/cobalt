CONSOLE WARNING: Listener added for a 'DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument' mutation event. This event type is deprecated, and will be removed from this browser VERY soon. Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a large risk of imminent site breakage. Consider using MutationObserver instead. See https://chromestatus.com/feature/5083947249172480 for more information.
CONSOLE MESSAGE: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': Only one element on document allowed.
