This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] cast float16 4D tensor to int64
  assert_true: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test cast int64 actual 137438953475 should be close enough to expected 3 by the acceptable 0 ULP distance, but they have 137438953472 ULP distance expected true got false
[FAIL] cast int64 4D tensor to float16
  assert_true: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test cast float16 actual 0 should be close enough to expected 1 by the acceptable 1 ULP distance, but they have 15360 ULP distance expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
