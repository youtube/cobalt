-- Given two slice Ids A and B, find the maximum difference
-- between the durations of it's direct children with matching names
-- for example if slice A has children named (X, Y, Z) with durations of (10, 10, 5)
-- and slice B has children named (X, Y) with durations of (9, 9), the function will return
-- the slice id of the slice named Z that is A's child, as no matching slice named Z was found
-- under B, making 5 - 0 = 5 the maximum delta between both slice's direct children
--
-- @arg janky_slice_id LONG The slice id of the parent slice that we want to
--                          cause among it's children.
-- @arg prev_slice_id  LONG The slice id of the parent slice that's the reference
--                          in comparison to |janky_slice_id|.
-- @ret breakdown_id   LONG The slice id of the breakdown that has the maximum
--                          duration delta.
