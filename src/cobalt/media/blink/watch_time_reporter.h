// Class for monitoring and reporting watch time in response to various state
// changes during the playback of media. At present we are only recording the
// watch time for audio+video playbacks.
// TODO(dalecurtis): We want to introduce a similar "listening time" metric in
// the near future to track audio only cases.
//
// Watch time for our purposes is defined as the amount of elapsed media time
// for audio+video media. A minimum of 7 seconds of unmuted, foreground media
// must be watched to start watch time monitoring. Watch time is checked every
// 5 seconds from then on and reported to multiple buckets: All, MSE, SRC, EME,
// AC, and battery.
//
// Any one of paused, hidden, or muted is sufficient to stop watch time metric
// reports. Each of these has a hysteresis where if the state change is undone
// within 5 seconds, the watch time will be counted as uninterrupted.
//
// Power events (on/off battery power) have a similar hysteresis, but unlike
// the aforementioned properties, will not stop metric collection.
//
// Each seek event will result in a new watch time metric being started and the
// old metric finalized as accurately as possible.
