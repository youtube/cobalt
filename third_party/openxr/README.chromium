Description:
OpenXR is a royalty-free, open standard that provides high-performance access to
Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)—collectively known as
XR—platforms and devices.

Local Modifications:
No modifications to upstream files. BUILD.gn contains all of the configurations
needed to build the OpenXR loader in Chromium, along with its dependencies. The
readme was expanded with information about transitive dependencies that are
copied directly into the OpenXR SDK repository.
Added dev/xr_android.h for prototyping xr_android extensions that are currently
under active development and not in any openxr release at present. This file is
expected to be superceded by any official definitions and may require additional
work before a roll containing those definitions can be conducted.
Forked android_utilites.cpp and manifest_file.cpp to allow for customizing to
ignore loading in Android ContentProvider supplied paths while investigating and
waiting for upstreaming.

Security Critical: yes

Description:
JNIPP is just a C++ wrapper for the standard Java Native Interface (JNI).It
tries to take some of the long-winded annoyance out of integrating your Java
and C++ code.

Local Modifications:
No modifications to upstream files. BUILD.gn contains all of the configurations
needed to build the library in Chromium. Since it is a transitive dependency
that was directly included in OpenXR SDK repository, the exact revision is
unknown. The library also does not have any versioned releases.

Description:
Python tool to generate C++ wrappers for (mostly Android-related) JNI/Java
objects. Generated files are typically slightly hand-modified.

Local Modifications:
No modifications to upstream files. BUILD.gn contains all of the configurations
needed to build the library in Chromium, along with its dependencies. Since it
is a transitive dependency that was directly included in OpenXR SDK repository,
the exact revision is unknown. The library also does not have any versioned
releases. The library contains auto-generated files with unknown hand-made
modifications. The library is triple-licensed, and the copy from OpenXR SDK
repository does not include a LICENSE file.
