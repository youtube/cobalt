module sandbox.mojom;

// Sandbox type that can be specified as an attribute of mojo interfaces.
// To specify the sandbox a service should be launched in, use the
// [ServiceSandbox=type] attribute.
// If your service does not need access to OS resources it should be
// possible to host it in |kService|. These values are mapped to
// //sandbox/policy/sandbox_type.h values.
enum Sandbox {
  // |kService| hosts 'computation only' services such as decoders that
  // use limited operating system services. Prefer to use this sandbox
  // if possible.
  kService,

  // |kServiceWithJit| hosts computation only services that make use of
  // dynamic code (e.g. v8 or wasm) but do not need access to OS resources.
  // Prefer |kService| if possible.
  kServiceWithJit,

  // Hosts generic utilities with limited access to system services.
  // On some platforms, may be slightly less locked down than |kService|.
  // For instance, it allows dynamic code and wider access to APIs on Windows.
  kUtility,

  // The audio service process. May be disabled by policy.
  kAudio,

  // Hosts the content decryption module. Allows pre-loading of CDM libraries.
  // - On Windows, when `CdmServiceBroker` is connected the CDM was not
  // sandboxed to allow CDM preloading.
  // - On Mac, the process is fully sandboxed when launched.
  // - On Linux/ChromeOS, the CDM is preloaded in the zygote sandbox.
  kCdm,

  // The network service. May be disabled by policy.
  kNetwork,

  // The on-device model execution service. This sandbox is equivalent to the
  // GPU process's sandbox, but can be used by service processes to host
  // trustworthy models that may process untrustworthy inputs.
  kOnDeviceModelExecution,

  // Runs with the same rights as the browser. Usually needed to improve
  // stability by hosting code that interacts with third party code in another
  // process.
  kNoSandbox,

  // Hosts the GPU service and can talk to GPU drivers and other OS APIs which
  // may not be expecting untrusted input.
  kGpu,

  // Composits PDF and XPS documents.
  kPrintCompositor,

  // Hosts untrustworthy web content. Blocks as much OS access as possible.
  // Unless disabled by policy, allows dynamic code (for wasm/v8). Services
  // should prefer to use kService or kUtility.
  kRenderer,

  // Like kUtility but allows loading of speech recognition libraries.
  kSpeechRecognition,

  // Like kService but allows loading of the optimization guide library.

  kVideoEffects,

  // Like kUtility but allows loading of screen AI library.

  kScreenAI,

  // The PPAPI plugin process. (Unsandboxed on Windows.)
  [EnableIf=enable_ppapi_sandbox]
  kPpapi,

  // Equivalent to no sandbox on all non-Fuchsia platforms.
  // Minimally privileged sandbox on Fuchsia.
  [EnableIf=is_fuchsia]
  kVideoCapture,

  // Allows access to file contents and Windows APIs for parsing icons from PE
  // files.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kIconReader,

  // Allows LPAC capabilities for the Windws Media Foundation CDM, including
  // internet and private network access, COM, Identity & others. Allows access
  // to files in the `mediaFoundationCdmFiles` Chromium lpac.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kMediaFoundationCdm,

  // Launches elevated. Used by the RemovableStorageWriter.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kNoSandboxAndElevatedPrivileges,

  // Like kUtility, but patches GDI during child startup in pdf_child_init.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kPdfConversion,

  // Interfaces with operating system print drivers.
  [EnableIf=enable_oop_printing]
  kPrintBackend,

  // |kXrCompositing| hosts XR Device Service on Windows.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kXrCompositing,

  // Allows LPAC capabilities for WinHttp. This only needs internet access,
  // policy access, and service access.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kWindowsSystemProxyResolver,

  // Used to protect processes that perform hardware video decode acceleration.
  // Currently uses the same policy as the GPU process sandbox. Warm-up does
  // something different depending on the video acceleration API: for VA-API, we
  // open the render node and load libva plus associated libraries (like i965 or
  // iHD). For V4L2, we set up the broker process to allow opening certain V4L2
  // devices and we load the libv4l2.so library.
  //
  // TODO(b/195769334): we're using the GPU process sandbox policy for now as a
  // transition step. However, we should create a policy that's tighter just for
  // hardware video decoding.
  [EnableIf=is_linux_or_chromeos_ash]
  kHardwareVideoDecoding,

  // Used to protect processes that perform hardware video encode acceleration.
  // Currently uses the same policy as the GPU process sandbox. Warm-up does
  // something different depending on the video acceleration API: for VA-API, we

  kLibassistant,

  // Nearby Presence.
  [EnableIf=is_chromeos_ash]

  // Hosts On Device Translation service.
  // Currently the sandboxing of the On Device Translation service needs
  // a dedicated sandbox type on macOS and Linux.
