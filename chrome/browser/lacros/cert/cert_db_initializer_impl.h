class Profile;

// Initializes the certificate database in Lacros-Chrome for the specified
// profile. This object should only be accessed on the UI thread, and requires
// the Mojo CertDatabase interface to be available on the `LacrosService`.
//
// On Lacros-Chrome, how a database is initialized depends on which profile is
// being used as well as the device capabilities.
//
// - For devices with a dedicated TPM, for the main profile the public slot will
//   be in the current user's cryptohome (a path is provided by Ash) and the
//   private slot will be on the TPM (its slot id is provided by Ash).
//
// - For devices with a dedicated TPM, Ash may also indicate that Lacros should
//   use the system slot stored on the TPM. If indicated, the main profile will
//   attempt to load the system slot (its slot id is provided by Ash). In case
//   of failure, the profile won't have access to certificates from the system
//   slot (it will log an error, but won't crash).
//
// - Devices without a dedicated TPM are currently not fully
//   supported. For the main profile the public slot be in the current user's
//   cryptohome (a path is provided by Ash), the private slot will be set to a
//   read-only slot that does not support modification or permanent objects.
//   TODO(b/197082753): Make the private slot reference the public slot (same as
//   in Ash).
//
// - For all devices, secondary profiles will be initialized with both
//   public and private slots set to read-only slots that do not
//   support modification or permanent objects.
//
// - If Ash provides a path/TPM slot, and Lacros is unable to load
//   it, Lacros will intentionally crash, to avoid ignoring
//   settings from Ash.
//
// - If Ash does not provide a path, this is an unexpected/invalid
//   state, but Lacros will fail into read-only mode.
