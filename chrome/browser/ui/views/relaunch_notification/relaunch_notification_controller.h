// A class that observes changes to the browser.relaunch_notification
// preference (which is backed by the RelaunchNotification policy
// setting) and upgrade notifications from the UpgradeDetector. The two
// values for the RelaunchNotification policy setting are handled as follows:
//
// On Chrome desktop:
// - Recommended (1): The controller displays the relaunch recommended bubble on
//   each change to the UpgradeDetector's upgrade_notification_stage (an
//   "annoyance level" of low, elevated, grace or high). Once the high annoyance
//   level is reached, the controller continually reshows a the bubble on a
//   timer with a period equal to the time delta between the "elevated" and
//   "high" showings.
//
// - Required (2): The controller displays the relaunch required dialog when the
// UpgradeDetector's upgrade_notification_stage changes to an "annoyance level"
// of low, elevated, and grace. The browser is relaunched when the "annoyance
// level" reaches "high".
//
// On Chrome OS both notifications (recommended and required, described above)
// are shown in the unified system tray, overwriting the default "update
// available" notification. It cannot be deferred, so it persists until reboot.
// In certain conditions, the preference value could be overridden by the
// UpgradeDetector which then takes priority over the original value and any
// further changes to the preference have no effect.
