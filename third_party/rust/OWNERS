# How to assign reviews
# =====================
#
# Consider assigning reviews to chrome-third-party-rust-reviews@google.com,
# rather than to a specific reviewer. This helps distribute review load and
# knowledge more evenly amongst the team. Automation will select a random
# reviewer and reassign the review within ~5 minutes. Googlers can read more
# about this at go/gwsq-gerrit.
chrome-third-party-rust-reviews@google.com

# Actual list of reviewers
# ========================
#
# The find-owners plugin does not support groups, so the actual `unsafe` Rust
# reviewers are listed below but tagged with {LAST_RESORT_SUGGESTION} so that
# Gerrit will preferentially suggest the gwsq review alias above.
#
# Please keep this list alphabetized and in sync with the gwsq config (see
# `chromium_gwsq/third-party-rust/config.gwsq`).
dcheng@chromium.org          #{LAST_RESORT_SUGGESTION}
liza@chromium.org            #{LAST_RESORT_SUGGESTION}
lukasza@chromium.org         #{LAST_RESORT_SUGGESTION}
