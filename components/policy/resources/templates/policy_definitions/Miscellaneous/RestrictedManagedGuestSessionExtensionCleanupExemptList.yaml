caption: Configure the list of extension IDs exempt from the restricted managed guest
  session clean-up procedure
desc: |-
  The policy only applies to managed guest sessions.
        Setting the policy specifies a list of extension IDs that are exempt from the restricted managed guest session clean-up procedure (see <ph name="DEVICE_RESTRICTED_MANAGED_GUEST_SESSION_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeviceRestrictedManagedGuestSessionEnabled</ph>).
        Leaving the policy unset means no extensions are exempt from the reset procedure.
