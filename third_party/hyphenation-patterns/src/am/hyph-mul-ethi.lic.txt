%         Hyphenation patterns for languages written using the Ethiopic script
%         for Unicode engines. They are not supposed to be linguistically
%         relevant in all cases and should, for proper typography, be replaced
%         by files tailored to individual languages.
% ==========================================
% This is a generated file.  If you wish to edit it, consider adapting the
% generating programme
% (https://github.com/hyphenation/tex-hyphen/blob/master/hyph-utf8/source/generic/hyph-utf8/languages/mul-ethi/generate_patterns_mul-ethi.lua).
%
% The BCP 47 language tag for that file is “mul-ethi” to reflect the fact that
% it can be used by multiple languages (and a single script, Ethiopic).  It is,
% though, not supposed to be linguistically relevant and should, for proper
% typography, be replaced by files tailored to individual languages.  What we
% do for the moment is to simply allow break on either sides of Ethiopic
% syllables, and to forbid it before some punctuation marks particular to
% the Ethiopic script (which we thus make letters for this purpose).
