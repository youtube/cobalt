caption: Configure extension installation blocklist
desc: |-
  Allows you to specify which extensions the users can NOT install. Extensions already installed will be disabled if blocked, without a way for the user to enable them. Once an extension disabled due to the blocklist is removed from it, it will automatically get re-enabled.

            A blocklist value of '*' means all extensions are blocked unless they are explicitly listed in the allowlist.

            If this policy is left not set the user can install any extension in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.
