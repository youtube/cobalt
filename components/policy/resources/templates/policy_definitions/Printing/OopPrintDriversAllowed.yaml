caption: Out-of-process print drivers allowed
default: true
desc: |-
  Controls if <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> interacts with printer drivers from a separate service process. Platform printing calls to query available printers, get print driver settings, and submit documents for printing to local printers are made from a service process. Moving such calls out of the browser process helps improve stability and reduce frozen UI behavior in Print Preview.

  When this policy is set to Enabled or not set, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will use a separate service process for platform printing tasks.

  When this policy is set to Disabled, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will use the browser process for platform printing tasks.

  This policy will be removed in the future, after the out-of-process print drivers feature has fully rolled out.
