// This is a helper class to |TFLiteModelExecutor| that watches for a model
// execution that runs for too long.
//
// Background/Motivation: TFLite Model Execution occurs on a background task
// runner, but we've seen from metrics that some models are extremely long
// running (example: 8s at 95 %ile) which is simply not tolerable, and should
// instead be cancelled outright after a reasonable duration.
//
// Notes:
// * The TFLite Library guarantees that their Cancel() method can be called from
// any thread.
// * This class is owned by TFLiteModelExecutor and lives on a background
// SequencedTaskRunner.
// * The base class' methods are privately inheirited because we must (re)set
// the |task_| pointer correctly with logic in this class, and not have the
// caller worry about it.
//
// Synchronization: This class takes a raw pointer to the TFLite Model Runner,
// which is created and destroyed frequently on the background task runner.
// Therefore the |task_| pointer is protected by a lock since it is set on one
// thread (the background sequence that executes the model), but maybe used on
// the watchdog's thread to cancel a long running execution.
// Care must be taken to ensure |ArmWithTask| and |DisarmOnExecutionComplete|
// are always called so that the internal |task_| pointer can be (re)set with
// the same timing as the model execution.
//
// The watchdog class is working on two sequences: execution sequence and
// wachdog sequence. |ArmWithTask| and |DisarmOnExecutionComplete| are called
// on the execution sequence. The watchdog is implemented with a
// base::OneShotTimer which lives and runs on the watchdog sequence. In case of
// an execution timeout, the watchdog notification is received by
// |AlarmOnWatchdogSequence| on the watchdog sequence. The deletion of this
// class must happen on the watchdog sequence to ensure that timer task can be
// cancelled on the right sequence.
