// This class keeps track of a queue of requests, and contains the logic to
// retry requests with some backoff policy. Each request has a
// net::BackoffEntry instance associated with it.
//
// The general flow when using this class would be something like this:
//   - requests are queued up by calling ScheduleRequest.
//   - when a request is ready to be executed, RequestQueue removes the
//     request from the queue, assigns it as active request, and calls
//     the callback that was passed to the constructor.
//   - (optionally) when a request has completed unsuccessfully call
//     RetryRequest to put the request back in the queue, using the
//     backoff policy and minimum backoff delay to determine when to
//     next schedule this request.
//   - call reset_active_request() to indicate that the active request has
//     been dealt with.
//   - call StartNextRequest to schedule the next pending request (if any).
