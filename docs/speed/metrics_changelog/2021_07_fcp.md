# First Contentful Paint Changes in M94

## Changes in Chrome 94

In Chrome 94, we make sure that paint timing is not triggered by content that is not visible
due to being under the effect of an `opacity: 0` style. This increases the accuracy of the
FCP metric as it is less likely to be triggered when no content is actually visible.
[Source code for this change](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3057290).

## How does this affect a site's metrics?

Some sites may see their FCP values increase.

## When were users affected?

Chrome 94 is currently scheduled to be released the week of September 21, 2021.
