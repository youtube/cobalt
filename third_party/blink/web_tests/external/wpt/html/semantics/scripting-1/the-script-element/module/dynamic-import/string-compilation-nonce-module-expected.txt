This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] setTimeout must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://web-platform.test:8001/html/semantics/scripting-1/the-script-element/module/imports-a.js?label=setTimeout"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
