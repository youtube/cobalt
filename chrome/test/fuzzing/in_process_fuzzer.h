//   environment.
// * centipede runs it in single-process browser_test mode (currently),

//   of Chrome.
// * in the future, snapshot fuzzers might pause a VM and resume
//   clones of it (to ensure a cleaner state for each iteration)
// To the extent possible, you should write your fuzzer to be
// implementation-independent and semantically express what
// should happen during such fuzzing of the whole browser.
