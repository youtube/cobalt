This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] navigator.identity.get() calling the API without user activation should reject with NotAllowedError.
  promise_rejects_dom: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'get' on 'CredentialsContainer': Digital identity API needs at least one provider." that is not a DOMException NotAllowedError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 0
[FAIL] navigator.identity.get() consumes user activation.
  assert_false: User activation should be consumed after navigator.identity.get(). expected false got true
Harness: the test ran to completion.
