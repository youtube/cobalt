# // components/metrics/structured/lib

This folder holds code that will be shared between Chromium and ChromiumOS. The
target directory in ChromiumOS is `//platform2/metris/structured/lib`. Thus,
this directory should only contain files that are included in libchrome.

The uprev process is currently manual. To manually update the ChromiumOS
repository, TODO(jongahn): Include instructions on how to do a manual uprev.
