- [Snap: Client Tracing at Scale](https://www.droidcon.com/2022/06/28/client-tracing-at-scale/) "With the wide range of Android devices, it can be
difficult to find the root cause of performance problems. By leveraging traces,
we can begin to understand the exact circumstances that led to a poor user
experience. We will discuss how we instrument our Snapchat app such that we can
have the necessary signals for explainability. Additionally, we will describe
how we incorporate tracing into our development process from local debugging,
to performance tests and finally in production."
