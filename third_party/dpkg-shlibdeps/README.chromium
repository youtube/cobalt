- 0002-fix-compatibility-for-chromium.patch
  dpkg-shlibdeps.pl comes from dpkg-dev, which depends on libdpkg-perl that
  provides perl modules for eg. locating shared libraries and getting a list of
  symbols from them. The API of libdpkg-perl is not stable (but changes very
  infrequently), so in some cases dpkg-shlibdeps.pl will be expecting APIs that
  do not exist on the system. This patch is a minimal set of changes that fixes
  compatibility for supported build environments (Ubuntu Xenial and later).
  Specifically, provide the debug() function, and don't expect exec_abi to be a
  member of Dpkg::Shlibs::Objdump::Object.
