// An AbstractTexture enables access to GL textures from the GPU process, for
// things that set up textures using some client's decoder.  Creating an
// AbstractTexture is similar to "glGenTexture", and deleting it is similar to
// calling "glDeleteTextures".
//
// There are some subtle differences.  Deleting an AbstractTexture doesn't
// guarantee that the underlying platform texture has been deleted if it's
// referenced elsewhere.  For example, if it has been sent via mailbox to some
// other context, then it might still be around after the AbstractTexture has
// been destroyed.
//
// Also, an AbstractTexture is tied to the decoder that created it, in the sense
// that destroying the decoder drops the reference to the texture just as if the
// AbstractTexture were destroyed.  While it's okay for the AbstractTexture to
// exist beyond decoder destruction, it won't actually refer to a texture after
// that.  This makes it easier for the holder to ignore stub destruction; the
// texture will be cleaned up properly, as needed.
