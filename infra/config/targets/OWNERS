# Files in this directory can generate .pyl files that are synced to
# //testing/buildbot and targets spec .json files for builders that have their
# tests set in starlark. The pyl files don't need to be owners controlled, see
# the comment in //testing/buildbot/OWNERS for the reasoning. The targets spec
# .json files have specific owners set in //infra/config/generated/OWNERS, so
# it's fine to make these files owned by everyone.
