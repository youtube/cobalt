// Client interface to an AndroidOverlay.  Once constructed, you can expect to
// receive either a call to ReadyCB or a call to FailedCB to indicate whether
// the overlay is ready, or isn't going to be ready.  If one does get ReadyCB,
// then one may GetJavaSurface() to retrieve the java Surface object.  One
// will get DestroyedCB eventually after ReadyCB, assuming that one doesn't
// delete the overlay before that.
// When DestroyedCB arrives, you should stop using the Android Surface and
// delete the AndroidOverlay instance.  Currently, the exact contract depends
// on the concrete implementation.  Once ContentVideoView is deprecated, it will
// be: it is not guaranteed that any AndroidOverlay instances will operate until
// the destroyed instance is deleted.  This must happen on the thread that was
// used to create it.  It does not have to happen immediately, or before the
// callback returns.
// With CVV, one must still delete the overlay on the main thread, and it
// doesn't have to happen before this returns.  However, one must signal the
// CVV onSurfaceDestroyed handler on some thread before returning from the
// callback.  AVDACodecAllocator::ReleaseMediaCodec handles signaling.  The
// fundamental difference is that CVV blocks the UI thread in the browser, which
// makes it unsafe to let the gpu main thread proceed without risk of deadlock
// AndroidOverlay isn't technically supposed to do that.
