caption: Control how Chrome Cleanup reports data to Google
default: null
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means if <ph name="CHROME_CLEANUP_NAME">Chrome Cleanup</ph> detects unwanted software, it may, in line with policy set by <ph name="SAFE_BROWSING_EXTENDED_REPORTING_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled</ph>, report about the scan to Google. <ph name="CHROME_CLEANUP_NAME">Chrome Cleanup</ph> asks users if they want the cleanup. It sends results to Google.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means if <ph name="CHROME_CLEANUP_NAME">Chrome Cleanup</ph> detects unwanted software, it won't report about the scan to Google, regardless of the value of <ph name="SAFE_BROWSING_EXTENDED_REPORTING_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled</ph>. <ph name="CHROME_CLEANUP_NAME">Chrome Cleanup</ph> asks users if they want the cleanup. The results aren't reported to Google.

        Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="CHROME_CLEANUP_NAME">Chrome Cleanup</ph> may, in line with policy set by <ph name="SAFE_BROWSING_EXTENDED_REPORTING_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled</ph>, report about scans for detecting unwanted software to Google. <ph name="CHROME_CLEANUP_NAME">Chrome Cleanup</ph> asks users if they want the cleanup and to share the results with Google to help with future unwanted software detection. These results have file metadata, automatically installed extensions, and registry keys, as described by the Chrome Privacy Whitepaper.

        On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft速 Windows速</ph>, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft速 Active Directory速</ph> domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>.
