caption: URL of an XML file that contains URLs that should never trigger a browser
  switch.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to a valid URL has <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> download the site list from that URL and apply the rules as if they were set up with the <ph name="BROWSER_SWITCHER_URL_GREYLIST_POLICY_NAME">BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist</ph> policy. These policies prevent <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> and the alternative browser from opening one another.

        Leaving it unset (or set to a invalid URL) means <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> doesn't use the policy as a source of rules for not switching browsers.

        Note: This policy points to an XML file in the same format as <ph name="IE_PRODUCT_NAME">Internet Explorer®</ph>'s <ph name="IEEM_SITELIST_POLICY">SiteList</ph> policy. This loads rules from an XML file, without sharing those rules with <ph name="IE_PRODUCT_NAME">Internet Explorer®</ph>. Read more on <ph name="IE_PRODUCT_NAME">Internet Explorer®</ph>'s <ph name="IEEM_SITELIST_POLICY">SiteList</ph> policy ( https://docs.microsoft.com/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/what-is-enterprise-mode )
