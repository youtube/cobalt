    A frame is deemed janky during a scroll if there was no presented frame in
    the previous vsync, and the current frame contains input that was not
    presented during the missed frame. Missed input is determined by comparing
    the timestamp of the earliest input of the current frame, to that of the
    last input of the previously presented frame. If the delta of the timestamps
    is less than a vsync + vsync/2, then the input is considered to have been
    intended for the missed frame. This metric reports the percentage of delayed
    frames within an arbitrary window of 64 frames.

    A frame is deemed janky during a scroll if there was no presented frame in

    is less than a vsync + vsync/2, then the input is considered to have been

    of vsyncs the frame was delayed by. The metric gets reported for a windows

    Percentage of touch lag that prediction wasn't able to remove.

    This is the ratio (Lag_with_prediction)/(Lag_without_prediction). Lag is the
    average distance between the finger and page positons during touch
    scrolling.

    0% means all the lag existing before prediction was removed. 100% means that
    prediction had no impact. Greater than 100% means that prediction introduced
    more lag.

    This metric doesn't distinguish between OverPrediction and UnderPrediction.

    Improvement of prediction in touch lag. It is defined as
    (Lag_without_prediction - Lag_with_prediction).

    Lag is the distance between the finger position and the rendered position.

    When positive, prediction improves touch performance (reduces lag). When
    negative, prediction worsens touch performance (increases lag).

    The duration of the interaction/interval is either 1s, or the time from when
    the user starts scrolling to lifting the finger, whichever is smaller.

    This metric uses directionless distances, therefore it doesn't distinguish
    between OverPrediction and UnderPrediction. A same absolute value of
    OverPrediction or UnderPrediction will result in the same PredictionImpact
    value.

  <summary>
    When a user performs a scroll using touchscreen, a sequence of touch-move
    events are generated leading to a sequence of gesture-scroll-update events.
    This metric measures total latency of those gesture-scroll-update events
    excluding the first one in the sequence and those that are inertial (i.e.
    generated as a result of a user fling). Total latency means the time from
    when the touch-move causing a gesture-scroll-update is generated until when
    the changes caused by the event are successfully presented on the screen.

    This histogram will eventually be replaced by its TotalLatency2 equivalent
    which uses an improved bucketing.
