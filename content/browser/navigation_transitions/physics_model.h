  // - A drag curve when the user swipes across the screen and before the user

  // - A spring model that bounces around the commit-pending point. It drives
  //   the commit-pending animation: to bounce the live page around the
  //   commit-pending point while waiting for the history navigation to commit.
  //   Equilibrium is the commit-pending position.
  // - A spring model that plays the invoke animation: to bring the page from
  //   the commit-pending point to completely out of the view port. Equilibrium
  //   is at the right edge for a back navigation.
  // - A spring model that plays the cancel animation: to bring the old live
  //   content back to the center of the viewport. Equilibrium is at the left
  //   edge for a back navigation.

  // user-gesture driven while the spring models are vsync driven. The
