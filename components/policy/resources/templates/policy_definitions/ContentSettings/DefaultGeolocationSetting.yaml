arc_support: If this policy is set to <ph name="BLOCK_GEOLOCATION_SETTING">BlockGeolocation</ph>,
  Android apps cannot access location information. If you set this policy to any other
  value or leave it unset, the user is asked to consent when an Android app wants
  to access location information.
caption: Default geolocation setting
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to 1 lets sites track the users' physical location as the default state. Setting the policy to 2 denies this tracking by default. You can set the policy to ask whenever a site wants to track the users' physical location.

        Leaving the policy unset means the <ph name="ASK_GEOLOCATION_POLICY_NAME">AskGeolocation</ph> policy applies, but users can change this setting.
