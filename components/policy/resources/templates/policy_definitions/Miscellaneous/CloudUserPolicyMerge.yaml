caption: Enables merging of user cloud policies into machine-level policies
default: false
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled allows policies associated with a <ph name="GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_PRODUCT_NAME">Google Workspace</ph> account to be merged into machine-level policies.

        Only policies originating from secure users can be merged. A secure user is affiliated with the organization that manages their browser using <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>. All other user-level policies will always be ignored.

        Policies that need to be merged also need to be set in either <ph name="POLICY_POLICYLISTMULTIPLESOURCEMERGELIST">PolicyListMultipleSourceMergeList</ph> or <ph name="POLICY_POLICYDICTIONARYMULTIPLESOURCEMERGELIST">PolicyDictionaryMultipleSourceMergeList</ph>. This policy will be ignored if neither of the two aforementioned policies is configured.

        Leaving the policy unset or setting it to Disabled prevents user-level cloud policies from being merged with policies from any other sources.
