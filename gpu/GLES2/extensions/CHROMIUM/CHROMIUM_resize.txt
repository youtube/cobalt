Overview

    This extension allows a client to request that the output surface be
    dynamically resized.

Issues

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    The command

        glResizeCHROMIUM(GLint width,
                         GLint height,
                         GLfloat scale_factor,
                         GLcolorSpace color_space,
                         GLboolean alpha);

    changes the current output surface to be changed.
    <width> and <height> specify the dimensions for the surface in pixels.
    <scale_factor> specifies the device scale factor for the surface.
    <color_space> specifies the color space in which the pixels of the surface
    should be interpreted by the display system. Note that this value does not
    impact blending. All blending will be done on the raw pixel values. It is
    valid to specify nullptr for <color_space>, which will be interpreted as
    the default (invalid) color space.
    <alpha> indicates whether or not the surface must allocate an alpha channel

Errors

    A context lost will result when this call fails, either because of an
    invalid parameter value or because of a runtime error such as an out of
    memory condition.

New State

    None.
