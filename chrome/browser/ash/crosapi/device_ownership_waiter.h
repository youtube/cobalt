  // - we are launching at the login screen: The device owner might not be
  //   determined yet.
  // - this is a guest session: Guest sessions can occur before the initial OOBE
  //   and are by design without an owner.
  // - this is a demo mode session: Same as guest session.
  // - we are running ChromeOS on Linux: The `DeviceSettingsService` is not
  //   behaving as in the real world for these builds, hence we can skip the
  //   check.
  //
  // Furthermore there are some situations that we don't need to special case,
  // although the ownership question might seem tricky:
  // - this is a managed guest session: To start a MGS, devices need
  //   to first go through enterprise enrollment, which is an action that
  //   already establishes device ownership.
  // - this is a kiosk session: Currently kiosk sessions are only allowed after
  //   enterprise enrollment, which similar to MGS, establishes device
  //   ownership.
