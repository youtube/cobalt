Description:
This project contains a header file (webauthn.h) for the native Windows 10 & 11
WebAuthn API (webauthn.dll). While the API is already shipping with Windows 10
Insider Preview builds (as of November 2018), the corresponding header file has
not yet been released into a Windows SDK that Chromium can depend on. We
therefore include the header via this open source repository for the time
being.

Local Modifications:
- added BUILD.gn and README.chromium
