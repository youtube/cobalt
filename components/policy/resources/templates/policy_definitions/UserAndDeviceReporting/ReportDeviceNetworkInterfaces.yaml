  This policy is deprecated in M96. Please use <ph name="REPORT_DEVICE_NETWORK_CONFIGURATION">ReportDeviceNetworkConfiguration</ph> and <ph name="REPORT_DEVICE_NETWORK_STATUS">ReportDeviceNetworkStatus</ph> instead.

        Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset has enrolled devices report the list of network interfaces with their types and hardware addresses.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means enrolled devices don't report the network interface.
