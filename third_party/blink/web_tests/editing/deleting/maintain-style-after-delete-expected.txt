Testcase for bug http://crbug.com/286219: When deleting editable content, typing style should be reset when moving into another node.

Deleting 'W' in blue color and then inserting 'O'. The following markup should show 'O' in blue color.:
| "H "
| <font>
|   color="#0000ff"
|   "O<#selection-caret>"

Inserting 'W' at the intersection of the two text nodes. The following markup should show that 'W' is not added in blue color.:
| "H W<#selection-caret>"
| <font>
|   color="#0000ff"
|   "O"

Deleting the blue colored text and the preceding space and then inserting 'W'. 'W' should not be in blue color in the following markup.:
| "HW<#selection-caret>"
