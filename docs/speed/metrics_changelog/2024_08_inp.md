# Interaction to Next Paint Changes in Chrome 128

## Enable EventTimingHandleOrphanPointerup by default

Although INP is not intended to measure scrolling performance, there were
certain sequences of Event dispatch where Event Timing unintentionally would
sometimes measure what would ultimately be a scroll starting interaction. We're
excluding these scroll starting interactions from INP measurement with this
change.

Note: this experiment was first landed in Chrome 125: [Treat Orphan Pointerup
As Non-Interaction](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/9d3f759094b33ae52dd99e44b182ab03bf0e8073), and was slowly rolled out.

## How does this affect a site's metrics?

Sites previously affected by scroll starting interactions may observe a drop in
number of interactions and an improvement on INP score since high outliers
result from scrolling during early loading are now excluded from INP
measurement.

## When were users affected?

Chrome 128 will be released the week of August 20, 2024.
