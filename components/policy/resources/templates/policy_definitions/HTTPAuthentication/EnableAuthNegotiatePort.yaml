caption: Include non-standard port in Kerberos SPN
default: false
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled and entering a nonstandard port (in other words, a port other than 80 or 443) includes it in the generated Kerberos SPN.

  Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means the generated Kerberos SPN won't include a port.
