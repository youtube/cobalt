caption: Enable RC4 cipher suites in TLS
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy was removed in M53 after RC4 was removed from <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        If the policy is not set, or is set to false, then RC4 cipher suites in TLS will not be enabled. Otherwise it may be set to true to retain compatibility with an outdated server. This is a stopgap measure and the server should be reconfigured.
