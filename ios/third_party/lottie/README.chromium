Description:
Lottie is a cross-platform library for iOS, macOS, tvOS, Android, and Web that
natively renders vector-based animations and art in realtime with minimal code.
Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported in the bodymovin JSON
format. Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from After Effects with
bodymovin, Sketch with Lottie Sketch Export, and from Haiku.
