# Quick Insert

Quick Insert is a feature in Ash that allows users to quickly insert
emojis, GIFs, links, images, and more. It is triggered via a dedicated
key on the keyboard or a keyboard shortcut. The user can search for
something in the Quick Insert window and insert it directly without
leaving the input field.
