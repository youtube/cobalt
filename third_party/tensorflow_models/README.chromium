Description:
The TensorFlow Model Garden is a repository with a number of different
implementations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and modeling solutions for
TensorFlow users.

Important: Only a small selection of the upstream files are actually committed
here. See update.sh in this directory.

Note:
There are two shim directories, "libutf" and "icu4c", used to redirect
includes for those directories to their Chromium versions which have slightly
different names than those used here.

Update Process/Notes:
The owners update this repository as needed, using the `update.sh` script. If
you need to roll this library sooner, please reach out to one of the owners so
all the dependencies and necessary validation tests can be run.

Local modifications with their associated descriptions are contained in the
patches/ subdirectory.
