caption: Allow <ph name="BASIC_AUTH">Basic</ph> authentication for HTTP
default: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset will allow <ph name="BASIC_AUTH">Basic</ph> authentication challenges received over non-secure HTTP.

        Setting the policy to Disabled forbids non-secure HTTP requests from using the <ph name="BASIC_AUTH">Basic</ph> authentication scheme; only secure HTTPS is allowed.

        This policy setting is ignored (and <ph name="BASIC_AUTH">Basic</ph> is always forbidden) if the <ph name="AUTH_SCHEMES_POLICY_NAME">AuthSchemes</ph> policy is set and does not include <ph name="BASIC_AUTH">Basic</ph>.
