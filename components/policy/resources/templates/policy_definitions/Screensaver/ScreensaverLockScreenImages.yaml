caption: User screensaver lock screen image source.
desc: |-
  Configures the list of images to display in the screensaver for the lock screen.

  Each item must be a URL referencing an image file. The image format must be JPEG, and the file size must not exceed 8MB. Invalid URLs and unsupported images will be ignored. The <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> device will download these images, and keep them in a local cache.

  The number of images to display in the screensaver is limited to 25. Only the first 25 URL entries from the list will be used.

  This policy will not have any effect if the <ph name="SCREENSAVER_LOCK_SCREEN_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">ScreensaverLockScreenEnabled</ph> policy is set to false.

  If this policy is unset, or the list does not contain any valid image references, the screensaver for the lock screen will not be displayed, regardless of the value set in the <ph name="SCREENSAVER_LOCK_SCREEN_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">ScreensaverLockScreenEnabled</ph> policy.
