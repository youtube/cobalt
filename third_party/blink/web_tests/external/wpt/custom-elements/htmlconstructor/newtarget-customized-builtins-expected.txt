This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] If prototype is not object (null), derives the fallback from NewTarget's GetFunctionRealm (customized built-in elements)
  assert_equals: Must use the HTMLParagraphElement from the realm of NewTarget expected object "[object HTMLParagraphElement]" but got object "[object HTMLParagraphElement]"
[FAIL] If prototype is not object (undefined), derives the fallback from NewTarget's GetFunctionRealm (customized built-in elements)
  assert_equals: Must use the HTMLParagraphElement from the realm of NewTarget expected object "[object HTMLParagraphElement]" but got object "[object HTMLParagraphElement]"
[FAIL] If prototype is not object (5), derives the fallback from NewTarget's GetFunctionRealm (customized built-in elements)
  assert_equals: Must use the HTMLParagraphElement from the realm of NewTarget expected object "[object HTMLParagraphElement]" but got object "[object HTMLParagraphElement]"
[FAIL] If prototype is not object (string), derives the fallback from NewTarget's GetFunctionRealm (customized built-in elements)
  assert_equals: Must use the HTMLParagraphElement from the realm of NewTarget expected object "[object HTMLParagraphElement]" but got object "[object HTMLParagraphElement]"
[FAIL] HTMLParagraphElement constructor must not get .prototype until it finishes its extends sanity checks, calling proxy constructor directly
  assert_equals: Should never have gotten .prototype expected 0 but got 1
[FAIL] HTMLParagraphElement constructor must not get .prototype until it finishes its extends sanity checks, calling via Reflect
  assert_equals: Should never have gotten .prototype expected 0 but got 1
Harness: the test ran to completion.
