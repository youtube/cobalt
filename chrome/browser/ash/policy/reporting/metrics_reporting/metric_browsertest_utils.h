// A utility that provides initialization support for metric browser tests.

// One main challenge of the metric browser tests is the delayed initialization
// (which enqueues info metric) by |MetricReportingManager|: It must be called
// after |MissiveClientTestObserver| has been set up (so setting delayed
// initialization time to zero won't work) but before the rest of the test body.
// Therefore, some mock time manipulation is required. Due to the complexity of
// mocking time in browser tests, this class addresses the issue as follows:
//
// - In its constructor, initial policy setup is skipped. This prevents delayed
// initialization task from being posted.
// - A method |SetUpDelayedInitialization| is provided. This should be called
// after |MissiveClientTestObserver| has been initialized and device settings
// have been set.
//
// To use this utility, create an instance as a fixture in the test class and
// pass in |DevicePolicyCrosBrowserTest::device_state_| to the constructor. This
// class maintains a pointer to the device state, and therefore it must be
// destroyed before the device state is. Check out
// network/network_info_sampler_browsertest.cc for an example.
