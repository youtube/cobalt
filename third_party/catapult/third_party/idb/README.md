Description:
This directory contains a modified version of the compiled JavaScript source for
idb, a tiny library that mirrors IndexedDB, but replaces the weird `IDBRequest`
objects with promises, plus a couple of other small changes.

The original source has been modified to support ES6 modules.

The source git repository can be found at:
