caption: Off hours intervals when the specified device policies are released
desc: Setting the policy means the specified device policies are ignored (use these
  policies' default settings) during the specified intervals. Device policies are
  reapplied by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> when the policy
  period starts or ends. The user is notified and forced to sign out when this period
  changes and device policy settings change (for example, when a user signs in with
  a disallowed account).
