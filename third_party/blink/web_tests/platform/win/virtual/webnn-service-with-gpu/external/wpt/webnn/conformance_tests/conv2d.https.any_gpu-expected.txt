[FAIL] depthwise conv2d float32 4D input and filter tensors options.groups= input_channels
  assert_less_than_equal: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test conv2d float32 actual 0 should be close enough to expected 1.165167212486267 by ULP distance: expected a number less than or equal to 8n but got 1066738739n
Harness: the test ran to completion.
