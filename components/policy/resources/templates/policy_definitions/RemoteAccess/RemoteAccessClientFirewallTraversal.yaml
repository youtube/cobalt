caption: Enable firewall traversal from remote access client
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy is no longer supported.
            Enables usage of STUN and relay servers when connecting to a remote client.

            If this setting is enabled, then this machine can discover and connect to remote host machines even if they are separated by a firewall.

            If this setting is disabled and outgoing UDP connections are filtered by the firewall, then this machine can only connect to host machines within the local network.
