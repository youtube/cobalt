# User Education

User Education in Chrome is designed to introduce users to new and
existing features with which they might not be familiar.

The user education system provides a common UX for nudging users towards
these features, including full, user-initiated tutorials.

If you want to understand the architecture of the User Education
subsystem, including its various configuration classes, [read this
document](/components/user_education/architecture.md).

If you'd like to just dive in and start implementing User Education UX
for your application or platform of choice, [instructions are provided
