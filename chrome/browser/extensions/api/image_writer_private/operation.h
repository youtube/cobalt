// Encapsulates an operation being run on behalf of the

// anything.  The operation's Start method should be called to start it, and
// then the Cancel method will stop it.  The operation will call back to the
// OperationManager periodically or on any significant event.
//
// Each stage of the operation is generally divided into multiple phases with
// Start() being the first phase and Complete() being the last. All phases
// except Complete() run on blocking thread and Complete() runs on the UI
// thread.

// TODO(haven): This class is current refcounted because it is owned by the
// OperationManager on the UI thread but needs to do work on blocking threads.
// There is probably a better way to organize this so that it can be represented
// by a WeakPtr, but those are not thread-safe.  Additionally, if destruction is
// done on the UI thread then that causes problems if any of the fields were
// allocated/accessed on the blocking thread.  http://crbug.com/344713
