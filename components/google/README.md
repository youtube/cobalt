The Google component deals with Google- (and Google-owned-property-)specific
URLs and utilities.  This includes functions that determine if URLs are various
types of Google URLs, getters for Google search URLs, and various URL
manipulation functions.

Since Chrome should serve users of all search engines, URLs, and products well,
be hesitant before keying behavior to these functions.  Consider whether the
proposed behavior would appear innocuous and appealing if you worked for a
direct Google competitor, as well as whether you'd want a standardized mechanism
for other sites to achieve the same results.
