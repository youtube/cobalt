caption: Migration strategy for ecryptfs
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy was removed in M87 and home directories will automatically migrate to ext4 at sign-in.
        Setting the policy specifies the action to take when the user's home directory was created with ecryptfs encryption. Unless ecryptfs-encrypted home directories migrate to ext4-encryption, Android apps might stop running.

        Setting the policy to:

        * Migrate (or an unsupported option such as AskUser or AskForEcryptfsArcUsers) means directories automatically migrate to ext4 at sign-in, without asking for user consent.

        * Wipe or MinimalMigrate means that, at sign-in, new ext4-encrypted home directories replace old ecryptfs-encrypted directories. To help the user avoid repeated sign-ins, MinimalMigrate tries to preserve sign-in tokens.

        * DisallowArc or leaving it unset prevents migration, and the user's Android apps stop running.

        This policy doesn't apply to kiosk users.

        Warning: Wipe and MinimalMigrate remove local data.
