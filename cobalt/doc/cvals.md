# Cobalt CVals

## Overview

CVals are globally accessible, thread-safe, key-value pairs within Cobalt, which
are primarily used for monitoring state and tracking performance and memory.
Each CVal is defined with a unique key and registered with the global
CValManager. The CValManager can subsequently be queried for the current value
of the key, which is returned as a string. CVals come in two varieties:

*   **PublicCVals** - active in all builds.
*   **DebugCVals** - only enabled in non-Gold builds.

## Usage

### Debug Console

The debug console can be toggled between three modes (off, on, and hud) by
pressing Ctrl-O. It displays the current values of registered CVals, updating
them at 60 Hz. The initially displayed values are determined by
`DEFAULT_ACTIVE_SET` in `debug_values/console_values.js`. However, this is
modifiable in the debug console hud.

The registered CVals can be viewed by entering `debug.cvalList()` into the debug
console. Additional CVals can be registered via
`debug.cvalAdd(substringToMatch)` and can be removed via
`debug.cvalRemove(substringToMatch)`. The current registered list can be saved
as a new set via `debug.cvalSave(set_key)`. At that point, the saved set can
later be loaded as the active set via the command, `debug.cvalLoad(set_key)`.

A full list of the commands available via the debug console is shown by entering
`debug.help()`.

### JavaScript

CVals are exposed to JavaScript via the H5vccCVal object. This provides an
interface for requesting all of the keys, which are returned as an array, and
for retrieving a specific CVal value, which is returned as an optional string,
via its CVal key. While the H5vccCVal object is usable in any build, only public
CVals are queryable in Gold builds.

Here are examples of its usage:

```
  > h5vcc.cVal.keys()
  < H5vccCValKeyList[151]

  > h5vcc.cVal.keys().length
  < 151

  > h5vcc.cVal.keys().item(8)
  < "Count.MainWebModule.Layout.Box"

  > h5vcc.cVal.getValue("Count.MainWebModule.Layout.Box")
  < "463"
```

### Event

The Event category currently consists of counts and durations (in microseconds)
for input events, which are tracked from when the event is first injected into
the window, until a render tree is generated from it. Each event type is tracked
separately; current event types are: *KeyDown*, *KeyUp*, *PointerDown*,
*PointerUp*.

    the event injection time.
*   **Event.Duration.MainWebModule.[EVENT_TYPE].DOM.InjectEvent** - The time
    taken to inject the event into the window object. This mainly consists of
    JavaScript time.

    mainly consists of JavaScript time.
*   **Event.Duration.MainWebModule.[EVENT_TYPE].DOM.UpdateComputedStyle** - The
    time taken to update the computed styles of all HTML elements (which also
    includes updating their matching rules). This will track closely with the
    event DOM counts.

    taken to fully lay out the box tree.
*   **Event.Duration.MainWebModule.[EVENT_TYPE].Layout.BoxTree.BoxGeneration** -

    within the BoxTree time.
*   **Event.Duration.MainWebModule.[EVENT_TYPE].Layout.BoxTree.UpdateUsedSizes** -
    The time taken to update the sizes of the boxes within the box tree, which

*   **Event.Duration.MainWebModule.DOM.VideoStartDelay** - The delay from the
    start of the event until the start of a video. NOTE1: This is not set until
    after the event completes, so it is not included in the value dictionary.
    NOTE2: This is not tracked by event type, so each new event will reset this
    value.
*   **Event.Time.MainWebModule.[EVENT_TYPE].Start** - Time when the event
    started.

#### DebugCVals

*   **MainWebModule.IsRenderTreeRasterizationPending** - Whether or not a render
    tree has been produced but not yet rasterized.
*   **MainWebModule.Layout.IsRenderTreePending** - Whether or not the layout is

### Media

#### PublicCVals

We have various SbPlayer metrics available which need to be enabled first using:
`h5vcc.settings.set("Media.EnableMetrics", 1)`

*   **Media.SbPlayerCreateTime.Minimum**
*   **Media.SbPlayerCreateTime.Median**
*   **Media.SbPlayerCreateTime.Maximum**
*   **Media.SbPlayerDestructionTime.Minimum**
*   **Media.SbPlayerDestructionTime.Median**
*   **Media.SbPlayerDestructionTime.Maximum**
*   **Media.SbPlayerWriteSamplesTime.Minimum**
*   **Media.SbPlayerWriteSamplesTime.Median**
*   **Media.SbPlayerWriteSamplesTime.Maximum**

#### DebugCVals

Media Pipeline exposes many State values, however we support multiple pipelines
at once, so we have to query for the current pipeline number to access them.
This can be done with `h5vcc.cVal.keys().filter(key =>
key.startsWith("Media.Pipeline.") && key.endsWith("MaxVideoCapabilities") &&
h5vcc.cVal.getValue(key).length === 0)` (If a Pipeline has MaxVideoCapabilities,
it implies that the Pipeline is a 10x player, i.e. a secondary small player, so
if MaxVideoCapabilities.length is 0, then it must be the primary pipeline.)
This will give back an answer like `Media.Pipeline.3.MaxVideoCapabilities` so
the main pipeline in this example is `3`. With the current pipeline number you
can then access (Switching out pipeline for the one returned from previous
query):

*   **Media.Pipeline.3.Started**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.Suspended**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.Stopped**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.Ended**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.PlayerState**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.Volume**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.PlaybackRate**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.Duration**

*   **Media.Pipeline.3.FirstWrittenAudioTimestamp**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.FirstWrittenVideoTimestamp**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.LastWrittenAudioTimestamp**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.LastWrittenVideoTimestamp**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.VideoWidth**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.VideoHeight**
*   **Media.Pipeline.3.IsAudioEosWritten**

        the intervals between the animation rasterizations included in the set.
*   **Renderer.Rasterize.AnimationsInterval.\*** - Tracks the duration of
    intervals between rasterization calls during a single animation and updates
    its stats when the animation ends. The stats include all of the animation’s
    rasterization intervals. This provides an accurate view of the framerate
    during the animation.
    *   **Renderer.Rasterize.AnimationsInterval.Cnt** - The number of intervals
        included in the stats. Accounts for all rasterizations that occurred
        during the animation.

        duration of the intervals between the animation rasterizations included
        in the set.

    between the layout's clock and the renderer's clock.
*   **Renderer.Rasterize.Animations.\*** - Tracks the duration of each
    rasterization call during a single animation and updates its stats when the
    animation ends. The stats are drawn from all of the animation’s
    rasterizations. Given that this only tracks the time spent in the
    rasterizer, it does not provide as accurate a picture of the framerate as
    DurationInterval and AnimationsInterval.
    *   **Renderer.Rasterize.Animations.Cnt** - The number of rasterization
