caption: Enable warnings for insecure forms
default: true
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy controls the treatment for insecure forms (forms that submit over HTTP) embedded in secure (HTTPS) sites in the browser.
         If the policy is enabled or unset, a full page warning will be shown when an insecure form is submitted. Additionally, a warning bubble will be shown next to the form fields when they are focused, and autofill will be disabled for those forms.
         If the policy is disabled, warnings will not be shown for insecure forms, and autofill will work normally.

         This policy is intended to be removed in Chrome 130.
