caption: Determines whether the built-in certificate verifier
  will enforce constraints encoded into trust anchors loaded from the platform
  trust store.
default: true
desc: |-
  X.509 certificates may encode constraints, such as Name Constraints,
  in extensions in the certificate. RFC 5280 specifies that enforcing such
  constraints on trust anchor certificates is optional. Starting in
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> 112, such constraints
  in certificates loaded from the platform certificate store will now be
  enforced.

  This policy exists as a temporary opt-out in case an enterprise encounters
  issues with the constraints encoded in their private roots. In that case this
  policy may be used to temporarily disable enforcement of the constraints
  while correcting the certificate issues.

  When this policy is not set, or is set to enabled,
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will enforce
  constraints encoded into trust anchors loaded from the platform trust store.

  When this policy is set to disabled,
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will not enforce
  constraints encoded into trust anchors loaded from the platform trust store.

  In <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 112,
  this policy has no effect if the
  <ph name="CHROME_ROOT_STORE_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">ChromeRootStoreEnabled</ph>
  policy is disabled.

  This policy is planned to be removed in
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 118.
