Description:
TensorFlow Text provides a collection of text related classes and ops ready
to use with TensorFlow 2.0. The library can perform the preprocessing
regularly required by text-based models, and includes other features useful
for sequence modeling not provided by core TensorFlow.

Local Modifications:
0001 - Run clang-format to make the rest of the patches easier for IDEs that
auto-format on save.

0002 - Change an includes to be the chromium third_party version.

0003 - The most involved fix to change absl::string_view, which isn't well
supported in Chromium so everything is changed to re2::StringPiece.

0004 - Many of the files that aren't built into Chromium still trigger DEPS
errors by the CQ, so those includes are just commented out.
