caption: Configure Bruschetta VMs on <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>

desc: |-
  Configure installation and runtime policies for Bruschetta VMs on
  <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>. This allows for
  third-party VMs to be installed by users. This feature is disabled by default.

  This policy is a map of configuration IDs to VM configurations. When a VM is
  installed from a configuration it is persistently associated with that
  configuration ID, and any runtime policies in that configuration apply to that
  VM. Multiple VMs may be installed from the same configuration on the same device.
