git-map-branches(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-map-branches -
include::_git-map-branches_desc.helper.txt[]

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git map-branches'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Git map-branches displays all local branches such that:

* Current branch is [aqua]#cyan#.
** The branch which will be modified with git-commit is denoted with an asterisk
   (`*`) after the name.
* Local branches are [green]#green#.
* Remote branches are [red]#red# (usually, the root of all other branches).
* 'branch-heads' branches are [blue]#blue#.
* `{NO UPSTREAM}` is a special placeholder in [fuchsia]#magenta#.
** Branches which have this as their parent are usually misconfigured, and
   should be assigned a parent by checking out the branch and running git branch
   --set-upstream-to=<correct parent branch>.

NOTE: If multiple branches are on the same commit, they will all be cyan.

OPTIONS
-------

--no-color::
  Turn off colors.

-v::
  Be more verbose. Pass once to show tracking info, twice for hash and review
  URL, thrice for review status.

EXAMPLE
-------

Given the hypothetical demo repo in linkgit:git-map[1]\'s EXAMPLE section, and
assuming that the `frozen_changes` branch was currently checked out, running
'git map-branches' would result in an output like:
