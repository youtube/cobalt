caption: Add restrictions on a managed account's usage as a secondary account on ChromeOS
default: all
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Removed in M122 - this is a server-side-only policy that never used the ChromeOS policy infrastructure for its propagation.
  If this policy is set to <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_ALL">'all'</ph> or not set, all usages of managed accounts are allowed. This may result in a managed account being a secondary account, which would only receive policies when the account is signed-in as a primary account in a browser Profile.
        Policies set to the account won't be enforced in the following scenarios:
          -  Being a secondary account at the OS level (Account Settings)
          -  Being a secondary account in a browser Profile

        If this policy is set to <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_SIGNIN">'primary_account_signin'</ph> on an account, this account will be allowed to sign in as a primary account only. It won't be allowed to sign in as a secondary account.
