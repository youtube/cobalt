Sbix compatibility note:
On 1/11/2018 Roel committed:
https://github.com/RoelN/ChromaCheck/commit/8e4c22477830a42eac7012e26e5b346c81d656a2#diff-ca9080785e92b181eb1570ce0eb6da61
which changed the font files and added a glyf outline to the uniE901 glyph in
the sbix test file.

SBIX fails to work correctly if there are no place holder outlines in contours
for a glyph in the glyf table. With the newer version, the tests pass.

Mac OS < 10.13 seems to have trouble determining the bounding box for SBIX fonts
which have non multiple of hundred units per em values. I.e. 1024 instead of
800, as the system emoji font. This is fixed in ChromaCheck fonts after revision
8dadeaafb179b5571e6acdad25f4660a1cdcd395.
