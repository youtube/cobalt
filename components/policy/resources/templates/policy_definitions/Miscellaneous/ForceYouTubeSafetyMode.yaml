  This policy is deprecated. Consider using <ph name="FORCE_YOUTUBE_RESTRICT_POLICY_NAME">ForceYouTubeRestrict</ph>, which overrides this policy and allows more fine-grained tuning.

        Forces YouTube Moderate Restricted Mode and prevents users from changing this setting.

        If this setting is enabled, Restricted Mode on YouTube is always enforced to be at least Moderate.

        If this setting is disabled or no value is set, Restricted Mode on YouTube is not enforced by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>. External policies such as YouTube policies might still enforce Restricted Mode, though.
