=====================================================================

Let's make a story. Add one sentence for every commit:

CHÃ„PTER 1:
It was a dark and blinky night; the rain fell in torrents -- except at
occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which
swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along
the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that
struggled against the elements. A hooded figure emerged.

It was a Domo-Banana.

"What took you so long?", inquired his wife.

Silence. Oblivious to his silence, she continued, "Did Mr. Usagi enjoy the
waffles you brought him?" "You know him, he's not one to forego a waffle,
no matter how burnt," he snickered.

The pause was filled with the sound of compile errors.

CHAPTER 2:
The jelly was as dark as night, and just as runny.
The Domo-Kun shuddered, remembering the way Mr. Usagi had speared his waffles
with his fork, watching the runny jelly spread and pool across his plate,
like the blood of a dying fawn. \"It reminds me of that time --\" he started, as
his wife cut in quickly: \"-- please. I can't bear to hear it.\". A flury of
images coming from the past flowed through his mind.

"You recall what happened on Mulholland drive?" The ceiling fan rotated slowly
overhead, barely disturbing the thick cigarette smoke. No doubt was left about
when the fan was last cleaned.

There was an poignant pause.
