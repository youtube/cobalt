// Module Overview: Starboard Speech Synthesis API
//
// A basic text-to-speech API intended to be used for audio accessibility.
//
// Implementations of this API should audibly play back text to assist
// users in non-visual navigation of the application.
//
// Note that these functions do not have to be thread-safe. They must
// only be called from a single application thread.

// Spoken language for the text should be the same as the locale returned
// by SbSystemGetLocaleId().

// If audio from previous SbSpeechSynthesisSpeak() invocations is still
// processing, the current speaking should continue and this new
// text should be queued to play when the previous utterances are complete.
