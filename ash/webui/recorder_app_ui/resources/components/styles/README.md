This folder contains shared style that can be used across different components.

TODO(pihsun): Making a component to share styles should be preferred across
directly sharing CSS. Have some suggestion / link to doc here? (Maybe recommend
only setting CSS variables instead of directly setting styles in the shared
CSS?)
