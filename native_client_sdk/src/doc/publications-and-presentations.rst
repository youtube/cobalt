External Publications
---------------------

In these articles outside developers and Google engineers describe their
experience porting libraries and applications to Native Client and
Portable Native Client. They share their insights and provide some tips
and instructions for how to port your own code.

Porting Nebula3 to Portable Native Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Andre Weissflog ported his Nebula3 engine to Portable Native Client (see
`his demos <http://www.flohofwoe.net/demos.html>`__). He discusses
`build systems
<http://flohofwoe.blogspot.de/2013/08/emscripten-and-pnacl-build-systems.html>`__
and `app entry
<http://flohofwoe.blogspot.de/2013/09/emscripten-and-pnacl-app-entry-in-pnacl.html>`__.

Porting Go Home Dinosaurs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Fire Hose Games <http://firehosegames.com>`_ developed a new webgame
`Go Home Dinosaurs
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icefnknicgejiphafapflechfoeelbeo>`_.
It features tower defense, dinosaurs, and good old fashioned BBQ. This
article explains their experiences developing for Native Client
including useful lessons learned to help you get started.

Porting Zombie Track Meat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Fuzzycube Software <http://www.fuzzycubesoftware.com>`_, traditionally
a mobile game development studio, talks about their adventure into the
web, porting the undead decathlon `Zombie Track Meat
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jmfhnfnjfdoplkgbkmibfkdjolnemfdk/reviews>`_
from Objective C to Native Client.

Porting AirMech
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Carbon Games <http://carbongames.com/>`_ chose Native Client as a
solution for cross-platform delivery of their PC game `AirMech
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hdahlabpinmfcemhcbcfoijcpoalfgdn>`_
to Linux and Macintosh in lieu of native ports. They describe the
porting process on their blog.
