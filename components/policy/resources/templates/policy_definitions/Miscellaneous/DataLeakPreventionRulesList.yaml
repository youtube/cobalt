caption: Sets a list of data leak prevention rules.
desc: |-
  Configures a list of rules to prevent data leak on <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>.
        Data leak can happen by copying and pasting data, transferring files, printing, screensharing, or taking screenshots ...etc.

        Each rule consists of the following:
        - A list of sources defined as URLs. Any data in the sources will be considered confidential data, to which the restrictions will be applied.
        - A list of destinations defined as URLs or components, to which the confidential data is either allowed or disallowed to be shared.
        - A list of restrictions to be applied on the data of the sources.

        Rules can be added to:
        - Control the clipboard data shared between the sources and the destinations.
        - Control taking screenshots of any of the sources.
        - Control printing of any of the sources.
        - Control the privacy screen when any of the sources is visible.
        - Control screen sharing of any of the sources.
        - Control files downloaded from any of the sources when they are transferred to the destination. Supported on <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> version 108 and higher.

        The restriction level can be set to BLOCK, ALLOW, REPORT, WARN.
        - If the restriction level is set to BLOCK, the action won't be allowed. If <ph name="DATA_LEAK_PREVENTION_REPORTING_ENABLED">DataLeakPreventionReportingEnabled</ph> is set to True, the blocked action will be reported to the admin.
        - If the restriction level is set to ALLOW, the action will be allowed.
        - If the restriction level is set to REPORT and <ph name="DATA_LEAK_PREVENTION_REPORTING_ENABLED">DataLeakPreventionReportingEnabled</ph> is set to True, the action will be reported to the admin.
        - If the restriction level is set to WARN, a user will be warned and may choose to proceed with or cancel the action. If <ph name="DATA_LEAK_PREVENTION_REPORTING_ENABLED">DataLeakPreventionReportingEnabled</ph> is set to True, showing the warning will be reported to the admin; proceeding with the action will also be reported.

        Notes:
        - PRIVACY_SCREEN restriction doesn't block the ability to turn on privacy screen, but enforces it when the restriction class is set to BLOCK.
        - Destinations cannot be empty in case one of the restrictions is CLIPBOARD or FILES, but they don't make any difference for the remaining restrictions.
        - DRIVE and USB destinations are ignored for CLIPBOARD restriction.
        - Format the URL patterns according to this format ( https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format ).

        If the policy is left not set, no restrictions will be applied.
