// Utility to queue up PushBuffer() and SetConfig() calls to be made
// asynchronously at a later time, when a synchronous call is not possible.
//
// Per the CmaBackend::Decoder::PushBuffer() method signature, an implementing
// class must continue to accept new buffers until returning the kBufferPending
// response, which then acts as a flow control mechanism. In some
// implementations of AudioChannelPushBufferHandler, kBufferPending is not a
// possible response code, so this class acts as a utility to add that
// functionality. Upon a failed PushBuffer call to the delegated instance,
// this class will call back asynchronously, either resulting in a successful
// push or retrying again at a later time.
//
// This class stores:
// - All AudioConfigs set while the underlying AudioChannelPushBufferHandler is
//   blocked.
// - A single PushBuffer call associated with the kBufferPending return value.
// Once any data is stored, it queues up a task on the task runner to try to
// call the associated function at a later time.
