class CertificateProvider;

// A keyed service that manages registrations of extensions as certificate
// providers. It exposes all certificates that are provided by extensions
// through a |CertificateProvider| object that can be created using
// |CreateCertificateProvider()|. Private key handles are exposed through
// net::ClientKeyStore. Sign operations are routed to the extension that exposed
// the certificate.
//
// The typical order of execution is as follows:
//  1. HTTPS server requests client certs or
//     chrome.platformKeys.selectClientCertificates is called.
//  2. This starts the certificate request with ID x.
//  3. All extensions registered for the event onClientCertificatesRequested are
//     notified, the exposed callback is bound to request ID x.
//  4. Wait for all extensions to reply to request with ID x
//     or time out.
//  5. Filter all certificates from extensions that replied to request with ID x
//     and from the platform.
//  6. Show the selection dialog, user will select one.
//  7. Create private key handle. As this call is not associated with a specific
//     certificate request it looks at the certificate list obtained by the most
//     recent certificate request (execution of 3-5), which may or may not have
//     had ID x.
//  8. Sign() function of the key handle is called.
//  9. Forward the sign request to the extension that registered the
//     certificate. This request has a new sign request ID y.
// 10. Wait until the extension replies with the signature or fails the sign
//     request with ID y.
// 11. Forward the signature or failure as result of the key handle's Sign()
//     function.
