Description:
Turbine is a header compiler for Java. This library does not provide versioning
or maven releases, so we need to pull it in and build it ourselves.

Since we have no working non-android java proto processor, we cannot yet build
it in GN, so we are using a prebuilt jar encapsulating all of its dependencies.

What version is this:
  * Run print_version.sh to find out the version.
  * New instances are uploaded by the packager bot:
    https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/builders/ci/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
  * The bot autoruns every 6 hours. Ping a trooper or a clank-build-core@ dev to
    trigger it if you need it sooner:
    https://luci-scheduler.appspot.com/jobs/chromium/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
  * New versions are rolled automatically by:
    https://autoroll.skia.org/r/turbine-chromium
