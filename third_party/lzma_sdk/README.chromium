Description:
This contains a part of LZMA SDK 24.09.

Local Modifications:
The original code can be found at https://7-zip.org/a/lzma2409.7z.

The 7z binaries are installed via a 3pp CIPD package into bin/ if Windows is
specified as a target OS in the .gclient file. There are two subdirectories in
bin/: win64/ and host_platform/. win64/ contains 64-bit Windows binaries to be
packaged in Chromium targets requiring it, and host_platform/ contains binaries
for the platform of the host where the Chromium source code is checked out and
built. host_platform/ binaries should be used for build scripts that call 7z
binaries. Supported platforms are:

* linux-amd64
* mac-amd64
* mac-rm64
* windows-386
* windows-amd64

7za.exe and 7zr.exe are both standalone command-line utilities to archive and
extract files. 7zr is "lightweight" and only handles 7zip extensions. 7za can
handle a few more.

The purposes of the patch in chromium.patch are:
1. Extend the search range for 7z archive signature to accomodate increased sfx
   binary size in debug builds.
2. Fix undefined behavior in CpuArch.h flagged by UBSan caused by invalid
   pointer casts.
3. Shorten segment names in Asm/x86/LzmaDecOpt.asm to make the build
   deterministic.
4. Remove files irrelevant to Chromium use.
5. Remove AVX and SSE41 code in LzFind.
