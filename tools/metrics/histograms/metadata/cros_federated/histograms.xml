  <summary>
    Logs training condition check results during a federated round, including
    the overall result (Pass/Failed) and particular reasons of failure. Libfcp
    calls training condition check periodically during a round and once the
    check fails, it aborts the round. Interpret the histogram with the following
    formulas:

    #all_calls = #Pass + #Failed; Failure rate = #Failed / (#Pass + #Failed)

    weight of one reason = #this_reason / #Failed

    Note: in one check, all failed conditions are logged as reasons (v.s. the
    first failed one only). Therefore the sum of all reasons can be greater than
    the number of Failed.

    Logs training condition check results before a federated round, including
