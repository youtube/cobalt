    The picture below is broken on purpose, to test additional code paths:
    <br>
    <img src="broken-image.png">
    <img src="broken-image.png">
    <br>
    We have 2 identical img tags above, because this used to trigger a
    DCHECK in MHTMLPartsGenerationDelegate::shouldSkipResource (the
    DCHECK would think that an img with a broken tag is included twice
    as an MHTML part;  MHTML files that have 2 MHTML parts with the same
    URI render fine in Chrome, but fail in Internet Explorer).  See
    https://crbug.com/586680 for some more details about the DCHECK.

    OTOH, this test hopefully covers more than just testing this one
    DCHECK - hopefully the broken image scenario hits some other corner
    cases as well.

    The link to the image below is broken on purpose, to test additional code
    paths - in particular in this case ResourceHandler::OnResponseStarted
    is not called at all and the failure is reported directly via
    ResourceHandler::OnResponseCompleted.  See also https://crbug.com/594219.
