    handled in `BrowsingTopicsService`. Redirects (for fetch and xhr) will be
    counted as separate histogram entries.

  <summary>
    If the scheduled topics calculation fails to run on time, records the
    elapsed time (in hours) from the scheduled time to the time of detection.
    This check occurs each time a new tab is created. The metric is recorded at

    for the first try of a calculation (i.e. separated from the timeout retry)
    after the calculation completes, or when it's detected to be hanging, or
    when it's canceled due to data races or browser shutdown.

  <summary>
    Records the time between top topic calculations. Recorded when a topic
    calculation finishes and results from a prior epoch are available. This
    metric is recorded even in case of a calculation failure (e.g. permission
    denied, etc.).

    retries of a previously failed calculation (due to hanging or data race).
