caption: Battery Charging Optimization
desc: |-
  Battery health can be affected by factors like frequent full charges and extended charging durations. This policy provides three options to optimize charging behavior and mitigate these factors, ultimately prolonging battery lifespan.

  Setting the policy to 1 - Standard or leaving it unset, the battery charges normally to 100%. This disables adaptive and limited charging.

  Setting the policy to 2 - Adaptive, the device learns your charging habits and delays charging to 100% until necessary. This helps prolong battery health.

  Setting the policy to 3 - Limited, the battery charges only to around 80% to maximize its lifespan.

  This policy overrides <ph name="DEVICE_POWER_ADAPTIVE_CHARGING_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DevicePowerAdaptiveChargingEnabled</ph>.

  The <ph name="DEVICE_POWER_BATTERY_CHARGING_OPTIMIZATION_POLICY_NAME">DevicePowerBatteryChargingOptimization</ph> and <ph name="DEVICE_POWER_ADAPTIVE_CHARGING_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DevicePowerAdaptiveChargingEnabled</ph> polices always take precedence over user settings.
