Description:
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for
developing Java applications and applets. (linux-x64)

Check Current Version:
 * run ./print_version.sh
 * Find the tag that looks like `version:2@<jdk version>.<md5 hash>`
 * The version is the <jdk version> part of the tag.

This Package is Auto-Rolled:
 * Minor versions are auto-rolled.
 * New instances are uploaded by the packager bot:
   https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/builders/ci/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
 * The bot autoruns every 6 hours. Ping a trooper or a clank-build-core@ dev to
   trigger it if you need it sooner:
   https://luci-scheduler.appspot.com/jobs/chromium/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
 * New packages are rolled automatically by:
   https://skia-autoroll.corp.goog/r/jdk-chromium

To roll to a new JDK major version:
 * File a bug under "Build > Android" to tag the roll commit with.
   * File a bug blocked on the first one under "Infra > Codesearch" to ask the team to verify Codesearch does not break from the roll.
   * Check for problems locally by:
     1) Download the new JDK to //third_party/jdk/current
     2) Add 'checkout_android_prebuilts_build_tools': True, to your .gclient custom_vars
     3) Use the GN args from https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/infra/builders/codesearch/codesearch-gen-chromium-android
     4) Build: cd out/kythe; KYTHE_CORPUS=foo KYTHE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=$PWD KYTHE_ROOT_DIRECTORY=$PWD/../.. autoninja base:base_java
     5) Build: third_party/android_deps/fetch_all.py --ignore-vulnerabilities --local
        * If this fails, see: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html
 * Test locally that builds (with Errorprone enabled) work.
 * Pause the auto-roller: https://skia-autoroll.corp.goog/r/jdk-chromium
 * Change the package in 3pp/fetch.py
 * Wait for the 3pp packager to create a new package
 * Land a manual roll by:
   * Updating Instance ID in //DEPS
     * Make sure to run the codesearch trybots "gen-android-try" and "gen-webview-try"
     * And also the 3pp trybot: "3pp-linux-amd64-packager"
   * Updating Version: at the top of this file.
 * Unpause the auto-roller.
