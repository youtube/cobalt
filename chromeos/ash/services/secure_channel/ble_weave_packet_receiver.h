  // CONNECTING:
  //   The connection hasn't been estabalished. Accept a CONNECTION_REQUEST if
  //   the receiver is a SERVER. Accept a CONNECTION_RESPONSE if the receiver is
  //   a CLIENT. All other packets cause the receiver to move into ERROR state.
  //   The state will transition to WAITING after a request/response if they
  //   do not have extra data. The state will transition to DATA_READY if the
  //   request/response have extra data since the extra data is treated as a
  //   complete data message. This state is never reentered.
  // WAITING:
  //   The reciever is ready but doesn't have any data. It's waiting for packet
  //   to arrive. Will accept all but connection request/response packets. The
  //   first data packet will move the receiver to the RECEIVING_DATA state. A
  //   connection close packet will move the receiver to the CONNECTION_CLOSED
  //   state. This state is also never reentered.
  // RECEIVING_DATA:
  //   The receiver is in middle of receiving a data message consisted of
  //   multiple packets. Will receive only data packets. The last data packet
  //   will move the receiver into DATA_READY state. This state can be entered
  //   once from WAITING and unlimited number of times from DATA_READY.
  // DATA_READY:
  //   The data message is ready to be retrieved. If the data is not retrieved
  //   before the next packet which will cause a transition, the data will be
  //   lost. Move to RECEIVING_DATA on receiving first data packet. Move to
  //   CONNECTION_CLOSED on receiving close. This state can be entered once from
  //   CONNECTING and unlimited number of times from RECEIVING_DATA.
  // CONNECTION_CLOSED:
  //   The connection is closed. Refuse any further messages. Allow the reason
  //   for close to be retrieved.
  // ERROR:
  //   Something bad happened along the way. Allow a reason to close be
  //   retrieved. The reason to close tells the receiver's user what reason to
  //   close the connection in case the user wants to send a CONNECTION_CLOSE.
