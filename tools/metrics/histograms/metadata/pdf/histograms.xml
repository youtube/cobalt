  <owner>andyphan@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>thestig@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Tracks user actions in the PDF viewer. Logged when the document is opened
    and when one of the relevant user actions is taken, such as opening the
    bookmarks bar or setting the zoom mode to fit-to-page. The enum values that
    are named &quot;First&quot; are logged only once per document, so that we
    can measure in what percentage of documents a given action was performed at
    least once.

    Tracks the PDF caret becoming visible for the first time when caret browsing
    mode is enabled. Logged only once per document. Always records true. Not
    recorded for Print Preview, since caret browsing mode is always disabled
    there.

    Tracks the time that it takes from creating the PDF engine to load the PDF
    until starting the render of the first set of visible pages. This metric is
    affected by PDF load time and network speed, therefore it's best to be used
    in comparisons to cancel out unrelated events and not as a standalone
    performance metrics. This metric is not stored for print preview.
