# Vulnerability Discovery: Chromium Graphics

This directory contains notes on vulnerabilities found during the study of
Chromium graphics subsystems.

Notes about vulnerabilities are kept separate from general descriptions of
features so we can publish general information without exposing sensitive
details about vulnerabilities that may not yet be fixed.

Aside from the issue of sensitivity, it's useful to talk about vulnerabilities
separately so we can go into detail about the *process* of vulnerability
discovery, including what worked and what didn't.
