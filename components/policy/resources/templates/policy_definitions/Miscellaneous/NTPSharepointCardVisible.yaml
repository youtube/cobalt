caption: Show SharePoint and OneDrive File Card on the New Tab Page (Beta)
default: false
desc: |- # TODO(crbug.com/376287682): insert HC article link
  This is a beta feature.

  This policy controls the visibility of the SharePoint and OneDrive File Card on the New Tab Page. The card will only be displayed on the New Tab Page if the policy is enabled and your organization authorized the usage of the SharePoint and OneDrive File data in the browser.

  SharePoint and OneDrive data will not be stored by the browser.

  The SharePoint and OneDrive Files recommendation card shows a list of recommended files.  It aims to address the issue of context switching and enhance productivity by giving users a shortcut to their most important documents.

  The Microsoft SharePoint and OneDrive card will require additional admin configuration. For detailed information on connecting the Chrome New Tab Page Card to Sharepoint, please see help article.

  If the <ph name="NTPCARDSVISIBLE">NTPCardsVisible</ph> is disabled, the SharePoint and OneDrive Card will not be shown. If <ph name="NTPCARDSVISIBLE">NTPCardsVisible</ph> is enabled, the SharePoint and OneDrive card will be shown if this policy is also enabled and there is data to be shown. If <ph name="NTPCARDSVISIBLE">NTPCardsVisible</ph> is unset, the SharePoint and OneDrive card will be shown if this policy is also enabled, the user has the card enabled in Customize Chrome, and there is data to be shown.
