Local Modifications:
The code contained in this directory is not pulled directly from the upstream
repo.  Only a subset of certain functions are ported.  Each function links back
to its original upstream implementation.  The directory structure and original
file names are preserved from upstream.  There's no build target for this
directory; instead, source files are directly #include'd in //ui/gfx/x.  The
LICENSE file is not copied from the upstream repo -- rather, it's obtained from
the copyright header at the top of each source file copied from the repo.
