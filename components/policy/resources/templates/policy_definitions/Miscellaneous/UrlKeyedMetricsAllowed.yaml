caption: Allow URL-keyed metrics collection
default: null
desc: |-
  If this policy is set to allowed or unset, URL-keyed metrics collection is allowed.
  If allowed and URL-keyed metrics collection is enabled by the user, URL-keyed metrics collection sends URLs of pages the user visits to Google to make searches and browsing better along with per-page usage statistics.
  URL-keyed metrics also includes the identifiers and usage statistics of other browser components that can modify or provide content, such as extensions.

  If this policy is set to disallowed, users cannot enable URL-keyed metrics collection.
