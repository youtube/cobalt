Security Critical: yes

Description:
Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well as a C
library implementation of that protocol.

Note: It appears that Wayland has been failing to register CPEs with
nvd.nist.gov. Thus the last actual CPEPrefix is 1.19.0, even though the latest
version is 1.21.0.

Modifications:
- Added wayland_scanner_wrapper.py to generate protocol code automatically.
- Added "include/" include_dirs for the wayland_server target
- Added automatic generation of protocol marshalling code.
- Made server/client generated with wayland_protocol template.
- Using a custom branch that includes a fix to a buffer size overflow bug.
- Added generate_configs.py that generates and copies config.h and
  wayland-version.h files into include and include/src.
