caption: Choose whether to allow clearing window.name for cross-site top-level
  navigations resulting in a new browsing context group.

default: true

desc: |-
  This policy controls whether window.name can be cleared for cross-site
  top-level navigations which result in a new browsing context group being
  created when the ClearCrossSiteCrossBrowsingContextGroupWindowName variation is
  enabled.

  The ClearCrossSiteCrossBrowsingContextGroupWindowName variation controls whether
  window.name will be cleared for cross-site top-level navigations. Examples of
  such navigations include a user navigating to a new site via the omnibox or
  clicking on a link to a new site when the link uses "target='_blank'
  rel='noopener'". Clearing window.name in these cases prevents information from
  potentially leaking between sites via the window.name property, improving user
  privacy. ClearWindowNameForNewBrowsingContextGroup policy is in place to
  restore the previous behavior. When the
  ClearCrossSiteCrossBrowsingContextGroupWindowName variation is enabled
  window.name will be cleared for qualifying navigations if this policy is set
  to Enabled or not set. If it is disabled, window.name will not be cleared.

  If you must use the policy to disable window.name clearing on qualifying
  navigations, please file a bug on
  <ph name="BUG_URL">$1<ex>https://crbug.com/new?component=1456652&amp;template=1937639&amp;cc=ladan@chromium.org,miketaylr@chromium.org&amp;noWizard=true</ex></ph>
  explaining your use case. The policy is scheduled to
  be offered through <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$2<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>
  version 142.
