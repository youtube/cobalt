# vpython VirtualEnv protobuf for "gsutil".
#
# See:
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/HEAD/vpython/api/vpython/spec.proto
#
# This is a "vpython" VirtualEnv specification applied to invocations of "gsutil"
# by the bootstrap wrapper, "gsutil.py". It ensures that any Python distribution
# has the expected Python packages installed.
#
# This is specifically relevant on Google Compute Engine invocations of
# "gsutil", where a stock system-deployed file in "/etc/" explicitly specifies
# that the "google_compute_engine" and "boto" Python packages are available.
