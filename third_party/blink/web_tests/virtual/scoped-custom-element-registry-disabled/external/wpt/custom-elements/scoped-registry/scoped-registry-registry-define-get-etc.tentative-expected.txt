This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Custom element registries with a registered custom element return the class in their get method, and the name in their getName method
  Failed to construct 'CustomElementRegistry': Illegal constructor
[FAIL] Scoped Custom element registries do not inherit names or classes from the global registry
  Failed to construct 'CustomElementRegistry': Illegal constructor
[FAIL] Scoped Custom element registries return the same constructor when it is defined in both
  Failed to construct 'CustomElementRegistry': Illegal constructor
[FAIL] Scoped Custom element registries allow registering name that exists in global registry
  Failed to construct 'CustomElementRegistry': Illegal constructor
[FAIL] Custom element registries with a registered custom element resolve the class in their whenDefined method
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to construct 'CustomElementRegistry': Illegal constructor"
[FAIL] Scoped Custom element registries resolve the same constructor from whenDefined when it is defined in both
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to construct 'CustomElementRegistry': Illegal constructor"
[FAIL] Scoped Custom element registry getters do not resolve globally registered classes from whenDefined
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to construct 'CustomElementRegistry': Illegal constructor"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
