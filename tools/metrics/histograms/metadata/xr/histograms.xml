<histogram name="VRSessionTime.WebVR" units="ms" expires_after="2025-03-09">
  <owner>alcooper@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>xr-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The duration of the VR session. Logged when a new disjoint session has
    begun, or when the session has ended in a non-continuable way. Restricted to
    the period that the browser is displaying WebVR (XR) content.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="VRViewerType" enum="VRViewerType" expires_after="2025-03-30">
  <owner>alcooper@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>xr-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>The type of headset being used for VR.</summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="XR.ARCore.DepthBufferSizeInPixels" units="pixels"
    expires_after="2025-02-02">
  <owner>bialpio@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>xr-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Recorded on every frame for as long as depth data is requested in an XR
    session backed by ARCore device. Measures the number of pixels (width *
    height) in the depth buffer obtained from ARCore.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="XR.ARCore.ImageCopyFastPath" enum="Boolean"
    expires_after="2024-12-22">
  <owner>alcooper@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>xr-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Recorded every time an image is copied out of ArCore. Measures if we take
    the &quot;fast&quot; direct copy path or have to copy pixel-by-pixel.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="XR.RuntimeUsed" enum="XRDeviceId" expires_after="2025-01-07">
  <owner>alcooper@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>xr-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Indicates which XR runtime was used for a session. Recorded when the session
    was successfully created.
