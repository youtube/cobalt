This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Generated Blob URLs are unique
PASS Blob URL starts with "blob:"
PASS Blob URL starts with "blob:" for Files
PASS Origin of Blob URL matches our origin
PASS Blob URL parses correctly
PASS Origin of Blob URL matches our origin for Files
PASS Blob URLs can be used in <script> tags
FAIL Blob URLs can be used in iframes, and are treated same origin Blocked a frame with origin "null" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
FAIL Blob URL fragment is implemented. Blocked a frame with origin "null" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
PASS Blob URLs can be used in XHR
PASS XHR with a fragment should succeed
PASS XHR of a revoked URL should fail
PASS Only exact matches should revoke URLs, using XHR
PASS Appending a query string should cause XHR to fail
PASS Appending a path should cause XHR to fail
PASS XHR with method "HEAD" should fail
PASS XHR with method "POST" should fail
PASS XHR with method "DELETE" should fail
PASS XHR with method "OPTIONS" should fail
PASS XHR with method "PUT" should fail
PASS XHR with method "CUSTOM" should fail
PASS XHR should return Content-Type from Blob
FAIL Revoke blob URL after open(), will fetch assert_unreached: Got unexpected error event Reached unreachable code
PASS Blob URLs can be used in fetch
PASS fetch with a fragment should succeed
PASS fetch of a revoked URL should fail
PASS Only exact matches should revoke URLs, using fetch
PASS Appending a query string should cause fetch to fail
PASS Appending a path should cause fetch to fail
PASS fetch with method "HEAD" should fail
PASS fetch with method "POST" should fail
PASS fetch with method "DELETE" should fail
PASS fetch with method "OPTIONS" should fail
PASS fetch with method "PUT" should fail
PASS fetch with method "CUSTOM" should fail
PASS fetch should return Content-Type from Blob
FAIL Revoke blob URL after creating Request, will fetch promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to fetch"
FAIL Revoke blob URL after creating Request, then clone Request, will fetch promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: garbageCollect is not defined"
PASS Revoke blob URL after calling fetch, fetch should succeed
Harness: the test ran to completion.
