// The SkFileMemoryChunkStream classes provide a stream type that mixes features
// of both file streams and memory streams. While the stream initially reads
// from its file like a file stream, it lazily caches newly encountered 32KB
// chunks of the file into memory, enabling it to avoid reading sections of the
// file more than once--subsequent reads into those cached sections are made
// directly from memory. This caching occurs until the manager's cache limit is
// exhausted. After this, reads into uncached sections of the stream are always
// made to the file and not cached, functioning similarly to a file stream.
// Reads into the already cached sections are still handled in memory.
//
// This stream type provides much of the speed benefits of memory streams, while
// also guaranteeing that memory will not be wasted on sections of files that
// are never used and that the combined memory usage of the streams will never
// exceed the specified limit. If the cache limit is set to 0, then the streams
// do no caching and fully function like file streams.
