// The global object corresponds to a DOMWindow instance. However, to

// use a shadow object as the global object and use the JS DOMWindow
// instance as the prototype for that shadow object. The JS DOMWindow
// instance is undetectable from JavaScript code because the __proto__
// accessors skip that object.
//
// The shadow object and the DOMWindow instance are seen as one object
// from JavaScript. The JavaScript object that corresponds to a
// DOMWindow instance is the shadow object. When mapping a DOMWindow
// instance to a V8 object, we return the shadow object.
//
// To implement split-window, see
//   1) https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17249
//   2) https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:SplitWindow
//   3) https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=296639
// we need to split the shadow object further into two objects:
// an outer window and an inner window. The inner window is the hidden
// prototype of the outer window. The inner window is the default
// global object of the context. A variable declared in the global
// scope is a property of the inner window.
//
// The outer window sticks to a LocalFrame, it is exposed to JavaScript
// via window.window, window.self, window.parent, etc. The outer window
// has a security token which is the domain. The outer window cannot
// have its own properties. window.foo = 'x' is delegated to the
// inner window.
//
// When a frame navigates to a new page, the inner window is cut off
// the outer window, and the outer window identify is preserved for
// the frame. However, a new inner window is created for the new page.
// If there are JS code holds a closure to the old inner window,
// it won't be able to reach the outer window via its global object.
