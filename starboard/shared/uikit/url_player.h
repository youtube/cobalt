// --- Functions -------------------------------------------------------------

// Creates a URL-based SbPlayer that will be displayed on |window| for the
// specified URL |url|, acquiring all resources needed to operate it, and
// returning an opaque handle to it. The expectation is that a new player will
// be created and destroyed for every playback.
//
// In many ways this function is similar to SbPlayerCreate, but it is missing
// the input arguments related to the configuration and format of the audio and
// video stream, as well as the DRM system. The DRM system for a player created
// with SbUrlPlayerCreateWithUrl can be set after creation using
// SbUrlPlayerSetDrmSystem. Because the DRM system is not available at the time
// of SbPlayerCreateWithUrl, it takes in a callback,
// |encrypted_media_init_data_encountered_cb|, which is run when encrypted media
// initial data is encountered.

// SbUrlPlayerCreate. This may only be run once for a given URL-based
// SbPlayer.

// Returns true if the given URL player output mode is supported by
// the platform.  If this function returns true, it is okay to call
// SbPlayerCreate() with the given |output_mode|.
bool SbUrlPlayerOutputModeSupported(SbPlayerOutputMode output_mode);

// Specified function to get extra information of an URL-based player. Writes
// URL-based player related information into |out_url_player_info|. This
// function may be called very frequently and is expected to be inexpensive.
//
// |player|: The URL-based player about which information is being retrieved.
// |out_url_player_info|: The url player related information.
