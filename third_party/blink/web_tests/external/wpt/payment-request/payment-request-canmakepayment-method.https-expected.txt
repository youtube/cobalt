Harness Error. harness_status.status = 1 , harness_status.message = Unhandled rejection: Failed to execute 'abort' on 'PaymentRequest': No show() or retry() in progress, so nothing to abort
FAIL If payment method identifier are supported, resolve promise with true. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "UnknownError: Renderer process could not establish or lost IPC connection to the PaymentRequest service in the browser process."
FAIL If request.[[state]] is "created", then return a promise that resolves to true for known method. assert_equals: if it throws, then it must be a NotAllowedError. expected "NotAllowedError" but got "UnknownError"
FAIL All methods are unsupported promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "UnknownError: Renderer process could not establish or lost IPC connection to the PaymentRequest service in the browser process."
FAIL Mix of supported and unsupported methods, at least one method is supported. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "UnknownError: Renderer process could not establish or lost IPC connection to the PaymentRequest service in the browser process."
FAIL If request.[[state]] is "interactive", then return a promise rejected with an "InvalidStateError" DOMException. promise_rejects_dom: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'show' on 'PaymentRequest': Already called show() once" that is not a DOMException AbortError: property "code" is equal to 11, expected 20
FAIL If request.[[state]] is "closed", then return a promise rejected with an "InvalidStateError" DOMException. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'abort' on 'PaymentRequest': No show() or retry() in progress, so nothing to abort"
