caption: Restrict accounts that are visible in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google
  Chrome</ex></ph>
desc: |-
  Contains a list of patterns which are used to control the visibility of accounts in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        Each Google account on the device will be compared to patterns stored in this policy to determine the account visibility in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>. The account will be visible if its name matches any pattern on the list. Otherwise, the account will be hidden.

        Use the wildcard character '*' to match zero or more arbitrary characters. The escape character is '\', so to match actual '*' or '\' characters, put a '\' in front of them.

        If this policy is not set, all Google accounts on the device will be visible in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.
