caption: Automatically grant permission to sites to connect all serial ports.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy allows you to list sites which are automatically granted permission to access all available serial ports.

        The URLs must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored. Only the origin (scheme, host and port) of the URL is considered.

        On <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>, this policy only applies to affiliated users.

        This policy overrides <ph name="DEFAULT_SERIAL_GUARD_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultSerialGuardSetting</ph>, <ph name="SERIAL_ASK_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">SerialAskForUrls</ph>, <ph name="SERIAL_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">SerialBlockedForUrls</ph> and the user's preferences.
