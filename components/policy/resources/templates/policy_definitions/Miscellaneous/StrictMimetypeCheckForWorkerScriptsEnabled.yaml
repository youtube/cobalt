caption: Enable strict MIME type checking for worker scripts
default: true
desc: "This policy enables strict MIME type checking for worker scripts.\n\n     \
  \ When enabled or unset, then worker scripts will use strict MIME type checking\
  \ for JavaScript, which is the new default behaviour. Worker scripts with legacy\
  \ MIME types will be rejected.\n\n      When disabled, then worker scripts will\
  \ use lax MIME type checking, so that worker scripts with legacy MIME types, e.g.\
  \ <ph name=\"MIMETYPE_TEXT_ASCII\">text/ascii</ph>, will continue to be loaded and\
  \ executed.\n\n      Browsers traditionally used lax MIME type checking, so that\
  \ resources with a number of legacy MIME types were supported. E.g. for JavaScript\
  \ resources, <ph name=\"MIMETYPE_TEXT_ASCII\">text/ascii</ph> is a legacy supported\
  \ MIME type. This may cause security issues, by allowing to load resources as scripts\
  \ that were never intended to be used as such. Chrome will transition to use strict\
  \ MIME type checking in the near future. The enabled policy will track the default\
  \ behaviour. Disabling this policy allows administrators to retain the legacy behaviour,\
  \ if desired.\n\n      See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#scriptingLanguage\
  \ for details about JavaScript / ECMAScript media types.\n      "
