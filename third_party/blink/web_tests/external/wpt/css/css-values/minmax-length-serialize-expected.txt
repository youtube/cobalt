This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] 'min(1px)' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(1px)'.
[PASS] 'min(1px)' as a computed value should serialize as '1px'.
[PASS] 'min(1in)' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(96px)'.
[PASS] 'min(1in)' as a computed value should serialize as '96px'.
[PASS] 'max(1px)' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(1px)'.
[PASS] 'max(1px)' as a computed value should serialize as '1px'.
[PASS] 'max(1in)' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(96px)'.
[PASS] 'max(1in)' as a computed value should serialize as '96px'.
[PASS] 'min(1PX)' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(1px)'.
[PASS] 'min(1PX)' as a computed value should serialize as '1px'.
[PASS] 'min(50px, 1in + 1px)' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(50px)'.
[PASS] 'min(50px, 1in + 1px)' as a computed value should serialize as '50px'.
[PASS] 'max(50px, 1in + 1px)' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(97px)'.
[PASS] 'max(50px, 1in + 1px)' as a computed value should serialize as '97px'.
[PASS] 'calc(1px + min(1in, 100px))' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(97px)'.
[PASS] 'calc(1px + min(1in, 100px))' as a computed value should serialize as '97px'.
[PASS] 'calc(1px + max(1in, 100px))' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(101px)'.
[PASS] 'calc(1px + max(1in, 100px))' as a computed value should serialize as '101px'.
[PASS] 'min(1px, 1em)' as a specified value should serialize as 'min(1px, 1em)'.
[PASS] 'min(1px, 1em)' as a computed value should serialize as '1px'.
[FAIL] 'calc(min(1px, 1in) + max(100px + 1em, 10px + 1in) + 1px)' as a specified value should serialize as 'calc(2px + max(1em + 100px, 106px))'.
  assert_equals: 'calc(min(1px, 1in) + max(100px + 1em, 10px + 1in) + 1px)' and 'calc(2px + max(1em + 100px, 106px))' should serialize the same in specified values. expected "calc(2px + max(1em + 100px, 106px))" but got "calc(2px + max(100px + 1em, 106px))"
[PASS] 'calc(min(1px, 1in) + max(100px + 1em, 10px + 1in) + 1px)' as a computed value should serialize as '118px'.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
