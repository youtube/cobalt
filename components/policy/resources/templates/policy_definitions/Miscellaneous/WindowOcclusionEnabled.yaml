  Enables window occlusion in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        If you enable this setting, to reduce CPU and power consumption <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will detect when a window is covered by other windows, and will suspend work painting pixels.

        If you disable this setting <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will not detect when a window is covered by other windows.

        If this policy is left not set, occlusion detection will be enabled.
