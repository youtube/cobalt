This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS HTMLElement constructor must throw a TypeError when NewTarget is equal to itself
PASS HTMLElement constructor must throw a TypeError when NewTarget is equal to itself via a Proxy object
PASS HTMLElement constructor must throw TypeError when it has not been defined by customElements.define
PASS Custom element constructor must throw TypeError when it does not extend HTMLElement
PASS Custom element constructor must throw TypeError when it does not extend the proper element interface
PASS HTMLElement constructor must infer the tag name from the element interface
PASS HTMLElement constructor must allow subclassing a custom element
PASS HTMLElement constructor must allow subclassing an user-defined subclass of HTMLElement
FAIL HTMLElement constructor must only get .prototype once, calling proxy constructor directly assert_equals: Should have gotten .prototype once expected 1 but got 2
FAIL HTMLElement constructor must only get .prototype once, calling proxy constructor via Reflect assert_equals: Should have gotten .prototype once expected 1 but got 2
FAIL HTMLElement constructor must only get .prototype once, calling proxy constructor via Reflect with no inheritance assert_equals: Should have gotten .prototype once expected 1 but got 2
FAIL HTMLElement constructor must not get .prototype until it finishes its registration  sanity checks, calling via Reflect assert_equals: Should never have gotten .prototype expected 0 but got 1
Harness: the test ran to completion.
