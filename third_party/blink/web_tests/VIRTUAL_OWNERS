# These owners approve changes to VirtualTestSuites.
#
# The following things should be checked whether they are justified in the
# CL description:
# - If the CL adds a new virtual suite, there will need a justification if
#   the test suite will run on more than one platform. It is preferred to
#   run the test suite on Linux if it can be run on any platform.
#
# - If the CL adds virtual tests (by adding new virtual suites or new
#   directories to existing virtual suites), how many tests the CL adds.
#
# - If the number of new tests is big (e.g. >=200)
#   - Whether the new tests need to run on platforms other than Linux.
#   - Whether the new directories are essential for test coverage.
#   - Whether other alternatives [1] are more suitable than virtual suites.
#   - The percentage of time the virtual suite will take. The author can
#     find this data in "layout_test_results" page ("Timing stats" in the
#     top-right corner) linked from "archive results for blink_web_tests"
#     step on try bots like linux-rel, mac-rel and win-rel.
#     Normally the percentage should be less than 5%.
#
# - The prefix of the virtual test suites should not be too long. There is
#   a 260 characters limit for the length of the path on Windows. The prefix
#   will be part of the path should a baseline be needed, and will cause
#   trouble at that time. A presubmit check will recommend that new prefixes
#   not exceed 48 characters, but this can be ignored if a longer name would
#   help readability.
#
# - The expiration date of the virtual test suite usually should be 6 month
#   from the creation of the test suite. The expiration date can be set to
#   'never' when it is not expected to expire. In this case an explanation is
#   required.
#
# - The owners field is a list of email addresses for the owners. New or updated
#   VTS should have this field set up properly.
