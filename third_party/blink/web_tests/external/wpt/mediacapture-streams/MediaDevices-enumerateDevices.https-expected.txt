This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] mediaDevices.enumerateDevices() is present and working - before capture
  assert_equals: deviceId should be empty string if getUserMedia was never called successfully. expected "" but got "default"
[FAIL] mediaDevices.enumerateDevices() is working - after video capture
  assert_equals: audio deviceId should be empty. expected 0 but got 7
Harness: the test ran to completion.
