caption: Allow SSH outgoing client connections in Terminal System App
default: true
default_for_enterprise_users: false
desc: |-
  If this policy doesn't exist (e.g. for unmanaged users), the SSH (Secure SHell) outgoing client connections feature in Terminal System App is enabled (default True).
        If the user is managed, and the policy is unset or Disabled, the feature is disabled in Terminal.
        Setting the policy to Enabled allows managed users to create outgoing client SSH connections in Terminal.
