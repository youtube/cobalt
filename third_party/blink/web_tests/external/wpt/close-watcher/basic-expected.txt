This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL close() with no user activation only fires close CloseWatcher is not defined
FAIL destroy() then close() fires no events CloseWatcher is not defined
FAIL close() then destroy() fires only one close event CloseWatcher is not defined
FAIL Esc key does not count as user activation, so it fires close but not cancel promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL destroy() then close via Esc key fires no events promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL Esc key then destroy() fires only one close event promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL close via synthesized escape key should not work CloseWatcher is not defined
FAIL destroy inside oncancel promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL destroy inside onclose is benign CloseWatcher is not defined
FAIL close inside oncancel should not trigger an infinite loop promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
FAIL close inside onclose should not trigger an infinite loop CloseWatcher is not defined
FAIL close with events added via addEventListener promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: CloseWatcher is not defined"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
