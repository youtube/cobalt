This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] setParameters() with codecs undefined should reject with InvalidModificationError (audio)
  promise_rejects_dom: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setParameters' on 'RTCRtpSender': Failed to read the 'codecs' property from 'RTCRtpParameters': Required member is undefined." that is not a DOMException InvalidModificationError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 13
[FAIL] RTCRtpSender.getParameters() should have codecs after negotiation (audio)
  assert_not_equals: got disallowed value 0
[FAIL] RTCRtpReceiver.getParameters() should have codecs after negotiation (audio)
