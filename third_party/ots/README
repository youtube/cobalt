OpenType Sanitizer
==================

The OpenType Sanitizer (OTS) parses and serializes OpenType files (OTF, TTF)
and WOFF and WOFF2 font files, validating them and sanitizing them as it goes.

The C library is integrated into Chromium and Firefox, and also simple
command line tools to check files offline in a Terminal.

The CSS [font-face property][1] is great for web typography. Having to use images
in order to get the correct typeface is a great sadness; one should be able to
use vectors.

However, on many platforms the system-level TrueType font renderers have never
been part of the attack surface before, and putting them on the front line is
a scary proposition... Especially on platforms like Windows, where it's a
closed-source blob running with high privilege.
