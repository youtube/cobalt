This test creates a child iframe, which in turn creates an EventSource then reloads. During commit for the reload, the EventSource is cancelled, and the EventSource's onerror handler in turn creates a new EventSource, which is then aborted slightly later during the commit process. This second EventSource's onerror handler detaches the iframe. This will cause the iframe to detach in the middle of commit, and shouldn't crash.
