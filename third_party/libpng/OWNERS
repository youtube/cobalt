# Product code (e.g. Chrome) does **not** depend on `libpng`
# (see https://crbug.com/443128323).

# `//build/config/android` depends on `//third_party/libwebp:cwebp` (see
# handling of `png_to_webp` in `//build/config/android/internal_rules.gni`).
# `cwebp` depends on `libpng`.  Therefore `//build/android/OWNERS` end up
# transitively owning `libpng`.
file://build/android/OWNERS

# `//third_party/weston` is used by `//ui/ozone/platform/wayland` (in test-only
# configurations - e.g. see `use_bundled_weston` which
# `//docs/ozone_overview.md` says may be needed, because "Running some test
# suites requires a Wayland server").  And `//third_party/weston` depends on
# `//third_party/libpng` through `//third_party/weston:cairo_shared`.
# Therefore `.../wayland/OWNERS` end up transitively owning `libpng`.
