    called.

    mode and *are not* WebAPKs. These are sites which do not meet the PWA
    eligibility criteria, but have an app manifest that specifies either
    standalone or fullscreen display. This bucket also contains PWA *and*
    non-PWA intents that were added to the homescreen *prior* to M57, as we
    cannot distinguish between them after they are added.
