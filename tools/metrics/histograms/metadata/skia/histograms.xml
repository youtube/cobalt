This file is used to generate a comprehensive list of Skia internal histograms
along with a detailed description for each histogram. In this case Skia internal
means: generated from w/in the Skia repo via one of the SK_HISTOGRAM_* macros.

For best practices on writing histogram descriptions, see
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/tools/metrics/histograms/README.md

Please follow the instructions in the OWNERS file in this directory to find a
reviewer. If no OWNERS file exists, please consider signing up at
go/reviewing-metrics (Googlers only), as all subdirectories are expected to
have an OWNERS file. As a last resort you can send the CL to
chromium-metrics-reviews@google.com.
