caption: Configure list of force-installed Isolated Web Apps
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies a list of isolated web apps (IWAs) that install silently.
        IWAs are applications that have useful security properties unavailable to normal web pages. They are packaged in a Signed Web Bundle. The public key of the Signed Web Bundle is used to create the Web Bundle ID that identifies the IWA.
        So far this policy works for Managed Guest Session only.

        Each list item of the policy is an object which has two mandatory fields: the update manifest <ph name="URL_LABEL">URL</ph> and Web Bundle ID of the Isolated Web App.

        Each item can also have optional fields: an IWA release/update channel name (update_channel) and a specific version to pin (pinned_version).
        If the "update_channel" is not set, then the value of "default" will be used. When the pinned_version is specified, the system will attempt to install that specific version (if available on the current update channel).
        By default, version pinning does not allow going back to older versions. Pinning an IWA to a specific version prevents it from being updated beyond that version. To unpin, remove this field.

          The name of the IWA's update/release channel. This value can be any string;
          no restrictions are imposed. If no value is provided, the "default"
          channel will be used.
      pinned_version:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Specifies the desired version of the IWA. If provided, the system will attempt to install this specific version and subsequently block any further updates.
          To unpin the app and enable updates again, remove this field.
          **Important:** If the provided version does not exist, the IWA will get stuck on the currently installed version.
          This is because after trying (and it this case failing) to update to pinned version, pinning disables any further automatic updates.
