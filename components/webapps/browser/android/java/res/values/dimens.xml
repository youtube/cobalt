    <!-- Web app dimensions
         There are two possible layouts for splash screens, which is chosen based on whether an
         icon was auto-generated by Chrome and whether the icon is bigger than a threshold. -->
    <dimen name="webapp_home_screen_icon_size">48dp</dimen>
    <!-- The Android Spec
         (https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive)
         states that the adaptive icon should be 108dp. It also states that the safe zone should
         be a circle with diameter being ~61% (66dp/108dp) of width.
         The Web Spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#icon-masks), however, states that the
         safe zone should be a circle with diameter being 80% of width.
         To bridge the difference in safe zone size percentage, we have to add a 15% padding on
         each size of original image. As a result, the ideal adaptive icon size for WebAPK is
         83dp -->
