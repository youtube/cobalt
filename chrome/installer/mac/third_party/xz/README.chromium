Description:
XZ Utils is general-purpose data compression software implementing the
modified Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain algorithm (LZMA2). This is used by the Mac
diff updaters, not Chrome itself. Still, we have set Shipped to yes to ensure
the license is included in chrome://credits.

Local Modifications:
 - codereview.settings is added.
 - patches/wunreachable-code-break.diff is applied. In xz/src/xz/args.c, the
   “break” following a call to message_filters_help, a noreturn function, is
   commented out to avoid triggering a -Wunreachable-code-break warning.

The upstream source is present in the xz directory. Other entries in this
directory are present for build integration:
  - This README.chromium.
  - BUILD.gn.
  - lzma_decompress.export.
  - A copy of the LICENSE file.
  - The contents of the patches directory, containing local patches applied to
    the upstream xz source.
  - config/mac/config.h, the ouptut of a “configure” run, with these changes:
     - HAVE_ARM64_CRC32’s definition is made conditional on __arm64__.
     - SIZEOF_SIZE_T’s definition is made conditional on __LP64__.
     - Various macros are undefined, because feature selection is handled by
       BUILD.gn. These transformations can be made by running:
       sed -E -e 's%^#define (HAVE_(CHECK|(EN|DE)CODER).*) 1$%/* #undef \1 */%'
       These macros are affected:
        - HAVE_CHECK_CRC32
        - HAVE_CHECK_CRC64
        - HAVE_CHECK_SHA256
        - HAVE_DECODERS
        - HAVE_DECODER_ARM

        - HAVE_DECODER_IA64
        - HAVE_DECODER_LZMA1
