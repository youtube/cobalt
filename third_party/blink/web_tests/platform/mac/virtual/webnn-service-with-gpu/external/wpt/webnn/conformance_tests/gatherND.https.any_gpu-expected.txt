[FAIL] gatherND float32 4D input and 1D uint32 indices
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'cast' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint32 for output, must be one of [float32, float16, int32, int8, uint8]."
[FAIL] gatherND float32 4D input and 1D int64 indices
