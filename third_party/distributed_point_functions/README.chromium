Description:
This library contains an implementation of incremental distributed point
functions, based on the paper by Boneh et al.

Local Modifications:
The directory code/ is a copy of the source code, modified in two ways. First,
all top-level directories other than dpf/ have been removed as they are unused.
Second, a .clang-format file has been added to disable automatic code
formatting. Parts of code/dpf/distributed_point_function_test.cc are also
adapted for fuzzing in fuzz/dpf_fuzzer.cc.

The source code pulled in depends on "glog/logging.h" which is not accessible
from chromium. As a workaround, we create a simple glog/logging.h that includes
the macros needed.
