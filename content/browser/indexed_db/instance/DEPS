# The code in this directory runs on bucket-specific threads (or, more
# specifically, task runners that draw from the threadpool).
# IndexedDBContextImpl, on the other hand, runs on its own task runner.
# All inter-thread interaction should be routed through the
# BucketContext and its delegate.
#
# Other than IndexedDBContextImpl, most code in the parent directory is
# sequence-agnostic.
