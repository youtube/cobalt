// (2) Sending a message to the phone which asks it to begin the setup flow;
//     upon receipt of the message, the phone displays a UI which asks the
//     user to enable apps access for Phone Hub.
// (3) Waiting for the user to complete the flow; once the flow is complete, the
//     phone sends a message back to this device which indicates that
//     apps access has been granted.
