This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Throws if the promise [[state]] is not "interactive"
PASS Calling abort() multiple times is always a new object.
FAIL The same request cannot be shown multiple times. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'abort' on 'PaymentRequest': No show() or retry() in progress, so nothing to abort"
FAIL Aborting a request before it is shown doesn't prevent it from being shown later. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'abort' on 'PaymentRequest': No show() or retry() in progress, so nothing to abort"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
