# For some platforms we do not include any test at all.
# - Fuchsia: No Crashpad support at all.
# - Windows: Crash reporting is disabled for the browser_tests.
# - ChromeOS/Lacros: When enabling Crashpad via command line parameter for
#     the browser_test, startup of the browser fails. This is probably due
#     to a failing lookup of the database folder in
#     |PlatformCrashpadInitialization|.
