# Mission

Current as of June 2017...

There are multiple efforts going on in Chromium to address memory. The mailing
list + bug system + slack in combination is meant to aid these efforts by:

   * creating a connecting place for all people who work on memory on Chrome
   * identifying and solving the most important memory problems that really need cross-team collaboration

Currently, the top 3 problems being work on are:

   * Improve user experience for Chrome users with many tabs on Desktop
   * Improve user experience for Chrome users on low-memory mobile devices.
   * Detect and fix memory regressions and leaks.
