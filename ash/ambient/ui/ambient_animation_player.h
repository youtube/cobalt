// Plays an AnimatedImageView in a loop until destruction. The "looping" logic
// meets ambient mode's custom requirements: The lottie animation may optionally
// have a "marker" embedded in it. The "marker" is a timestamp set by the motion
// designer, which in this case, indicates where the animation should restart
// after each cycle ends. If the marker timestamp is M and the total animation
// cycle duration is D (where 0 < M < D), then the animation cycles look
// like this:
// [0, D]
// [M, D]
// [M, D]
// ...
//
// Note the very first animation cycle is always played starting at time 0 (the
// very first frame in the animation).
//
// If the animation does not have a marker embedded in it, the default behavior
// is to restart at the beginning of the animation each time (M is effectively
// 0):
// [0, D]
// [0, D]
// [0, D]
