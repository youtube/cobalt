# Ignore all vendored third-party code. If any first-party code need to be
# formatted, please put a config under your own directory to void this one.
# NOTE: until https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-format/issues/870 is done,
# this file will NOT have effect. Also swiftfmt has to be updated. At this
# stage (2025-Q1) there is no easy way for swiftfmt to ignore files.
