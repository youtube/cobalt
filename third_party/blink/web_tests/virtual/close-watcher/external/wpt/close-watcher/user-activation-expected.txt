This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS CloseWatchers created without user activation, but close()d via user activation, fires cancel
PASS CloseWatchers created without user activation, but close()d via user activation, fires cancel, which can be preventDefault()ed
PASS CloseWatchers created without user activation, but closed via a close signal after user activation, fires cancel
PASS CloseWatchers created without user activation, but closed via a close signal after user activation, fires cancel, which can be preventDefault()ed
PASS Multiple CloseWatchers created without user activation close together (with no cancel)
PASS Creating a CloseWatcher from user activation keeps it separate from the free CloseWatcher, but they don't fire cancel
PASS Creating a CloseWatcher from user activation, and close()ing CloseWatchers with user activation, fires cancel
PASS Creating a CloseWatcher from user activation, and closing CloseWatchers with a close signal after user activation, fires cancel
PASS Multiple CloseWatchers created with user activation close in reverse order
PASS 3 user activations let you have 3 + 1 = 4 ungrouped close watchers/0 cancel events
PASS 3 user activations let you have 2 close watchers with 1 cancel event, even if the first cancel event is prevented
PASS destroy()ing the free CloseWatcher allows a new free one to be created without user activation, and it receives the close signal
PASS close()ing the free CloseWatcher allows a new free one to be created without user activation, and it receives the close signal
PASS closing the free CloseWatcher via a close signal allows a new free one to be created without user activation, and it receives a second close signal
PASS The second watcher can be the free watcher, if the first is created with user activation
PASS The third watcher can be the free watcher, if the first two are created with user activation
Harness: the test ran to completion.
