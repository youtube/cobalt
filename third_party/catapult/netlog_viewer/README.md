This app loads [NetLog
files](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-stack/netlog)
generated by Chromium's `chrome://net-export`. Log data is processed and
visualized entirely on the client side (your browser). Data is never uploaded
to a remote endpoint.

The latest version of the net log viewer can be accessed at:
