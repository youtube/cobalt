// Represents a service worker that is a 'controller'.
// (https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#navigator-service-worker-controller)
// One of its Mojo end points (i.e. the caller end) is passed to the
// controllee in the renderer process, and used from there.  Its other Mojo
// end point (i.e. the destination of the events) is implemented by
// ControllerServiceWorkerImpl in the renderer process where the controller
// service worker runs.
//
// The controllees use this interface to directly talk to the controller. This
// implements a small subset of the ServiceWorker interface, namely dispatch
// methods for Fetch and PostMessage, because ordering must be preserved
// between them: controller.postMessage(...), controller.fetch(‘...’); from
// the page must result in a message event then fetch event dispatched to the
// service worker. They are believed to be the only events whose ordering
// guarantee is observable from the page context.

  // handled by the ServiceWorker interface, as the fetch is initiated
  // in the browser-process during the navigation)

  // handler ran and all outstanding respondWith() and waitUntil() promises have
  // settled. |response_callback| is called once the promise to respondWith()
  // settles, or when the event handler ran without calling respondWith().
