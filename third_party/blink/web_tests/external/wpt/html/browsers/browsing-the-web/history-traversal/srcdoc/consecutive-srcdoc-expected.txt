This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] changing srcdoc does a replace navigation since the URL is still about:srcdoc
[FAIL] changing srcdoc to about:srcdoc#yo then another srcdoc does two push navigations and we can navigate back
  assert_equals: srcdoc content must be restored from history expected "srcdoc1" but got "srcdoc2"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
