caption: Allow Web Kiosk to open more than one browser window on any screen
default: false
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means a Kiosk Web App can open another browser window which can be placed on the same screen or on a different screen. To open a new window, Web App should call <ph name="OPEN_NEW_WINDOW_JS">window.open(url, target, windowFeatures)</ph> JavaScript function.

        Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means a Kiosk Web App can use only the main browser window and cannot open a new window. Calling any Javascript functions for opening a new window will be ignored.
