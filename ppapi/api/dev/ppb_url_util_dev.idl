/*
 * A component specifies the range of the part of the URL. The begin specifies
 * the index into the string of the first character of that component. The len
 * specifies the length of that component.
 *
 * This range does not include any special delimiter for that component, so
 * the scheme doesn't include the trailing colon, the username and password
 * don't include the @ and :, the port doesn't include the colon, the query
 * doesn't include the ?, and the ref doesn't include the #.
 *
 * The exception is that the path *does* include the first /, since that's an
 * integral part of the path.
 *
 * If the component is not present at all, begin will be 0 and len will be -1.
 * If the component is present but empty, the length will be 0 instead. Example:
 *   http://foo/search    -> query = (0, -1)
 *   http://foo/search?   -> query = (18, 0)
