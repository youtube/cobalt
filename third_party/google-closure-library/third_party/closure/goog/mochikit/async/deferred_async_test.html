  // Required for the test. Sadly we cannot set the uncompiled/compiled defines since the actual
  // _test.html file will evaluate this after goog.async.Deferred has already been loaded, and thus
  // the default value of LONG_STACK_TRACES set. And doing this in the _test.js causes a compile
  // error. This statement will be evaulated before the tests run, however, so it is still safe to
  // put here.
