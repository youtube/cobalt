caption: Device MAC address source when docked
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets the administrator change the MAC (media access control) address when connecting a device to the dock. When a dock is connected to some device models, by default, the device's designated dock's MAC address helps identify the device on Ethernet.

        If 'DeviceDockMacAddress' is selected or the policy is left unset, the device's designated dock MAC address will be used.

        If 'DeviceNicMacAddress' is selected, the device's NIC (network interface controller) MAC address will be used.

        If 'DockNicMacAddress' is selected, the dock's NIC MAC address will be used.

        Users can't change this setting.
