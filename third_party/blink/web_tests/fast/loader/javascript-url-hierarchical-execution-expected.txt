This tests to see what Chromium does with invalid javascript urls of the form "javascript://".
These should be detected as hierarchical, but invalid urls if the host part includes spaces.
JavaScript execution nor navigation should not happen and you should remain at this page.
On the other hand, if the contents after "javascript:" are considered valid javascript code, a comment, that may be executed and you should remain at this page too.
See wpt/url/javascript-urls.window.js, which tests whether javascript code is executed or not.
If you click the link below and Chromium tries to navigate - probably to an error page - then the test failed.
In DumpRenderTree, if the custom policy delegate indicates that a load was attempted, then the test failed.
