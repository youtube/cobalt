caption: Configure native messaging blocklist
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies which native messaging hosts shouldn't be loaded. A deny list value of <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph> means all native messaging hosts are denied, unless they're explicitly allowed.

        Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> loads all installed native messaging hosts.
