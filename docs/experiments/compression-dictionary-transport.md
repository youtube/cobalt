# Compression Dictionary Transport

- Contact: <compression-dictionary-transport-experiment@chromium.org>
- Feedback: <https://github.com/WICG/compression-dictionary-transport/issues>
- Chrome status: <https://chromestatus.com/feature/5124977788977152>

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the current implementation status of the
[**Compression Dictionary Transport**][explainer] feature in Chrome and
instructions on how to enable it.

Starting from version 117, Chrome experimentally supports Compression Dictionary
Transport feature. This feature adds support for using designated previous
responses, as an external dictionary for Brotli- or Zstandard-compressed HTTP
responses.

## Activation

This API can be enabled by chrome://flags or via [Origin Trial][ot-blog].

### chrome://flags

If you want to try Compression Dictionary Transport feature, you have to enable
both [chrome://flags/#enable-compression-dictionary-transport][flag] and
[chrome://flags/#enable-compression-dictionary-transport-backend][backend-flag].
The details about each flag are described [here][shared_dictionary_readme].

### Origin Trial

Origin Trial token can be obtained from [the Origin Trial console][ot-console].
You can enable this feature by setting `Origin-Trials` HTTP response header in
the page's HTML,

```http
Origin-Trial: YOUR_ORIGIN_TRIAL_TOKEN
```

or adding a meta tag in the &lt;header&gt; element.

```html
<meta http-equiv="origin-trial" content="YOUR_ORIGIN_TRIAL_TOKEN">
```

### Third-Party Origin Trial

This feature supports third-party Origin Trial. If you are serving third-party
scripts, you can enable this feature by adding a meta tag.

```javascript
(() => {
  const meta = document.createElement('meta');
  meta.httpEquiv = 'origin-trial';
  meta.content = 'YOUR_THIRD_PARTY_ORIGIN_TRIAL_TOKEN';
  document.head.appendChild(meta);
})()
```

Currently third-party Origin Trial doesn't support `Origin-Trial` HTTP
response header. See [this doc][third-party-ot-dd] for more details.

### Origin Trial and the backend feature

The origin trial token works only when the backend of this feature is enabled.
Currently, the backend is gradually being rolled out. So the backend may not be
enabled in your Chrome yet. If you want to try this feature using an Origin
Trial token, please enable the backend at
[chrome://flags/#enable-compression-dictionary-transport-backend][backend-flag].

#### Why the backend is not enabled for all Chrome yet?

When the backend is enabled, Chrome will check the dictionary database while
fetching resources. This may negatively affect Chrome's loading performance.
Therefore, we are conducting experiments to ensure that this does not cause
regressions before rolling it out to all users.

TODO(crbug.com/1413922): When we enable the backend for all Chrome, remove this
section.

## Feature detection

If you want to check whether the Compression Dictionary Transport feature is
enabled or not, you can try the following code:

```javascript
document.createElement('link').relList.supports('dictionary')
```

If the code above returns true, the Compression Dictionary Transport feature is
enabled.

## Registering dictionaries

When Chrome receives a HTTP response with `use-as-dictionary: <options>` header,
and if the the response type is not opaque, Chrome registers the response as a
dictionary.

Chrome supports following options (see [the explainer][explainer] for more
details):

- **match**
  - URL-matching pattern for the dictionary to apply to.
  - In the explainer, this field only supports the asterisk `*` wildcard. But
    currently Chrome supports both the asterisk `*` wildcard expansion and the
    question `?`.
  - In the explainer, this field supports relative URLs (eg: `./js/*`). But
    currently Chrome only supports absolute paths (eg: `/map/js/*`).
- **expires**
  - Expiration time in seconds for the dictionary.
  - This field is optional and defaults to `31536000` (1 year).
  - While running the Origin Trial experiment, the max expiration time is
    limited to 30 days. This limitation can be removed by enabling
    [chrome://flags/#enable-compression-dictionary-transport][flag].
- **algorithms**
  - List of supported hash algorithms in order of server preference.
  - This field is optional and defaults to `(sha-256)`.
  - Currently Chrome only supports `sha-256`. So if this field is set but it
    doesn't contain `sha-256`, Chrome doesn't register the response as a
    dictionary.
- **type**
  - Dictionary format.
  - This field is optional and defaults to `raw`.
  - Currently Chrome only supports `raw`. So if this field is set but it is not
    `raw`, Chrome doesn't register the response as a dictionary. This logic of
    checking **type** was [introduced at M118][type-option-cl].

Note: These options fields are expected to change when we officially launch this
feature, depending on the outcome of [the spec discussion][httpbis-draft].

## Fetching dedicated dictionaries

Chrome fetches a dedicated dictionary when it detects
`<link rel="dictionary" href="DICTIONARY_URL">` in the page, or
`Link: <DICTIONARY_URL>; rel="dictionary"` HTTP response header is set in the
response of the page's HTML file.

## Using dictionaries

While fetching a HTTP request, Chrome match the request against the available
dictionary `match` URL patterns. If there are multiple matching dictionaries,
Chrome currently uses the dictionary with the longest `match` URL pattern.

If a dictionary is available for the request, Chrome will add `sbr` the
`Accept-Encoding` request header, as well as a
`sec-available-dictionary: <SHA-256>` header with the hash of the dictionary.

## Supported compression scheme

Chrome 117.0.5857.0 introduced support for Shared Brotli, and Chrome
118.0.5952.0 adds support for Shared Zstandard.

Shared Zstandard can be enabled/disabled from
[chrome://flags/#enable-shared-zstd][shared-zstd-flag].

## Debugging

### Managing registered dictionaries

Developers can manage the registered dictionaries in
[chrome://net-internals/#sharedDictionary][net-internals-sd].

### DevTools

Developers can check the related HTTP request and response headers
(`Use-As-Dictionary`, `Sec-Available-Dictionary`, `Accept-Encoding` and
`Content-Encoding`) using DevTools' Network tab.

## Known issues

- [crbug.com/1468156](crbug.com/1468156): `encodedBodySize` property and
  `transferSize` property of `PerformanceResourceTiming` for shared dictionary
  compressed response are wrong. Currently it returns as if the response is not
  compressed.
- [crbug.com/1479465](crbug.com/1479465): Can't store large (>40 MB)
  dictionaries. Fixed in M118, by setting a [100 MB size limit](100mb-limit-line)
  if there is enough disk space.
- [cbrbug.com/1479809](crbug.com/1479809): Can't use large (>8MB) dictionaries
  for Shared Zstd. Fixed in M118.
