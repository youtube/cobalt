# Network Traffic Annotations

[TOC]

This document presents a practical guide to using network traffic annotations in
Chrome.


## Problem Statement

To make Chrome’s network communication transparent, we would need to be able to
provide the following answers:
* What is the intent behind each network request?
* What user data is sent in the request, and where does it go?

Besides these requirements, the following information helps users, admins, and
help desk:
* How can a network communication be stopped or controlled?
* What are the traces of the communication on the client?

It should be noted that the technical details of requests are not necessarily
important to the users, but in order to provide the intended transparency, we
need to show that we have covered all bases and there are no back doors.


## The Solution

We can provide up to date, in-line documentation on origin, intent, payload, and
control mechanisms of each network communication. This is done by adding a
`NetworkTrafficAnnotationTag` to all network communication functions.
Please note that as the goal is to specify the intent behind each network
request and its payload, this metadata does not need to be transmitted with the
request during runtime and it is sufficient to have it in appropriate positions
in the code. Having that as an argument of all network communication functions
is a mechanism to enforce its existence and showing the users our intent to
cover the whole repository.


## Best Practices

### Where to add annotation?
All network requests are ultimately sending data through sockets or native API
functions, but we should note that the concern is about the main intent of the
communication and not the implementation details. Therefore we do not need to
specify this data separately for each call to each function that is used in the
process and it is sufficient that the most rational point of origin would be
annotated and the annotation would be passed through the downstream steps.
Best practices for choosing annotation code site include where:
  1. The origin of user’s intent or internal requirement for the request is
      stated.
  2. The controls over stopping or limiting the request (Chrome settings or
     policies) are enforced.
  3. The data that is sent is specified.
If there is a conflict between where is the best annotation point, please refer
to the `Partial Annotations` section for an approach to split annotation.

### Merged Requests
There are cases where requests are received from multiple sources and merged
into one connection, like when a socket merges several data frames and sends
them together, or a device location is requested by different components, and
just one network request is made to fetch it. In these cases, the merge point
can ensure that all received requests are properly annotated and just pass one
of them to the downstream step. It can also pass a local annotation stating that
it is a merged request on behalf of other requests of type X, which were ensured
to all have annotations.
This decision is driven from the fact that we do not need to transmit the
annotation metadata in runtime and enforced annotation arguments are just to
ensure that the request is annotated somewhere upstream.


## Coverage
Network traffic annotations are currently enforced on all url requests and
socket writes, except for the code which is not compiled on Windows or Linux.
This effort may expand to ChromeOS in future and currently there is no plan to
expand it to other platforms.


## Network Traffic Annotation Tag

`net::NetworkTrafficAnnotationTag` is the main definition for annotations. There
are few variants of it that are specified in later sections. The goal is to have
one object of this type or its variants as an argument of all functions that
create a network request.

### Content of Annotation Tag
Each network traffic annotation should specify the following items, as defined
in the `NetworkTrafficAnnotation` message of
`chrome/browser/privacy/traffic_annotation.proto`:
* `uniqueـid`: A globally unique identifier that must stay unchanged while the
  network request carries the same semantic meaning. If the network request gets
  a new meaning, this ID needs to be changed. The purpose of this ID is to give
  humans a chance to reference NetworkTrafficAnnotations externally even when
  those change a little bit (e.g. adding a new piece of data that is sent along
  with a network request). IDs of one component should have a shared prefix so
  that sorting all NetworkTrafficAnnotations by unique_id groups those that
  belong to the same component together.
* `source`: These set of fields specify the location of annotation in
  the source code. These fields are automatically set and do not need
  specification.
* `semantics`: These set of fields specify meta information about the
  network request’s content and reason.
   * `sender`: What component triggers the request. The components should be
     human readable and don’t need to reflect the components/ directory. Avoid
     abbreviations, and use a common value for all annotations in one component.
   * `description`: Plaintext description of the network request in language
     that is understandable by admins (ideally also users). Please avoid
     acronyms and describe the feature and the    feature's value proposition as
     well.
   * `trigger`: What user action triggered the network request. Use a textual
     description. This should be a human readable string.
   * `user_data`: What nature of data is being sent, as enums. 
      Any personally identifiable (PII) data, provided by user or generated 
      by Google, should be pointed out. You can include multiple 
      values, and you may want to supplement this with the data field. 
      All available User data enums can be found [here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/privacy/traffic_annotation.proto?q=UserDataType).
   * `data`: Textual description of data being sent, for things that aren't 
      covered by user_data enum values. You can also use this field if 
      more context needs to be provided to describe user_data.
   * `destination`: Target of the network request. It can be either the website
     that user visits and interacts with, a Google service, a request that does
     not go to network and just fetches a local resource, or other endpoints
     like a service hosting PAC scripts. The distinction between a Google owned
     service and website can be difficult when the user navigates to google.com
     or searches with the omnibar. Therefore follow the following guideline: If
     the source code has hardcoded that the request goes to Google (e.g. for
     ZeroSuggest), use  `GOOGLE_OWNED_SERVICE`. If the request can go to other
     domains and is perceived as a part of a website rather than a native
     browser feature, use `WEBSITE`. Use `LOCAL` if the request is processed
     locally and doesn't go to network, otherwise use `OTHER`. If `OTHER` is
     used, please add plain text description in `destination_other`
     field.
   * `destination_other`: Human readable description in case the destination
     points to `OTHER`.
   * `internal`: Data that is meant to be visible internally, example point of contacts, 
      should be placed inside internal field. This field should not be used in any
      external reports.
     * `contacts`: A person's or team's email address who are point-of-contact 
        for questions, issues, or bugs related to this network request.
   * `last_reviewed`: Date when this annotation was last reviewed in YYYY-MM-DD format.
* `policy`: These set of fields specify the controls that a user may have
  on disabling or limiting the network request and its trace.
   * `cookies_allowed`: Specifies if this request stores and uses cookies or
     not. Use values `YES` or `NO`.
   * `cookies_store`: If a request sends or stores cookies/channel IDs/... (i.e.
     if `cookies_allowed` is true), we want to know which cookie store is being
     used. The answer to this question can typically be derived from the
     URLRequestContext that is being used. The three most common cases will be:
      * If `cookies_allowed` is false, leave this field unset.
      * If the profile's default URLRequestContext is being used (e.g. from
        `Profile::GetRequestContext())`, this means that the user's normal
        cookies sent. In this case, put `user` here.
      * If the system URLRequestContext is being used (for example via
        `io_thread()->system_url_request_context_getter())`, put `system` here.
      * Otherwise, please explain (e.g. SafeBrowsing uses a separate cookie
        store).
   * `setting`: Human readable description of how to enable/disable a feature
     that triggers this network request by a user (e.g. “Disable ‘Use a web
     service to help resolve spelling errors.’ in settings under Advanced”).
     Note that settings look different on different platforms, make sure your
     description works everywhere!
   * `chrome_policy`: Policy configuration that disables or limits this network
     request. This would be a text serialized protobuf of any **non-device**
     enterprise policy. See policy list or
     `out/Debug/gen/components/policy/proto/chrome_settings.proto` for the full
     list of policies.
     * Note: Use `chrome_device_policy` instead for device policies.
   * `chrome_device_policy`: Policy configuration that disables or limits this
     network request. This would be a text serialized protobuf of any
     **device** enterprise policy. See
     `components/policy/proto/chrome_device_policy.proto` for the full list of
     policies.
     * Note: Use `chrome_policy` instead for non-device policies (e.g. user
     policies).
   * `policy_exception_justification`: If there is no policy to disable or limit
     this request, a justification can be presented here.
   * `deprecated_policies`: Policy names disabling or limiting this network request
      which are currently deprecated. These should be a subset of the policies in the
      `chrome_policy` field. If a policy is removed from the `chrome_policy` field, 
      then it should be removed from this field also.
* `comments`: If required, any human readable extra comments.

### Format and Examples
Traffic annotations are kept in code as serialized protobuf. To define a
`NetworkTrafficAnnotationTag`, you may use the function
`net::DefineNetworkTrafficAnnotation`, with two arguments, the unique id, and
all other fields bundled together as a serialized protobuf string.

#### Good examples
```cpp
  net::NetworkTrafficAnnotationTag traffic_annotation =
      net::DefineNetworkTrafficAnnotation("spellcheck_lookup", R"(
        semantics {
          sender: "Online Spellcheck"
          description:
            "Chrome can provide smarter spell-checking by sending text you "
            "type into the browser to Google's servers, allowing you to use "
            "the same spell-checking technology used by Google products, such "
            "as Docs. If the feature is enabled, Chrome will send the entire "
            "contents of text fields as you type in them to Google along with "
            "the browser’s default language. Google returns a list of "
            "suggested spellings, which will be displayed in the context menu."
          trigger: "User types text into a text field or asks to correct a "
                   "misspelled word."
          internal {
            contacts {
                email: "chrome-spellcheck@google.com"
            }
          }
          user_data {
            type: USER_CONTENT
          }
          data: "Text a user has typed into a text field. No user identifier "
                "is sent along with the text."
          destination: GOOGLE_OWNED_SERVICE
          last_reviewed: "2022-10-17"
        }
        policy {
          cookies_allowed: NO
          setting:
            "You can enable or disable this feature via 'Use a web service to "
            "help resolve spelling errors.' in Chrome's settings under "
            "Advanced. The feature is disabled by default."
          chrome_policy {
            SpellCheckServiceEnabled {
                SpellCheckServiceEnabled: false
            }
          }
        })");
```

```cpp
  net::NetworkTrafficAnnotationTag traffic_annotation2 =
      net::DefineNetworkTrafficAnnotation(
        "safe_browsing_chunk_backup_request",
        R"(
        semantics {
          sender: "Safe Browsing"
          description:
            "Safe Browsing updates its local database of bad sites every 30 "
            "minutes or so. It aims to keep all users up-to-date with the same "
            "set of hash-prefixes of bad URLs."
          trigger:
            "On a timer, approximately every 30 minutes."
          data:
            "The state of the local DB is sent so the server can send just the "
            "changes. This doesn't include any user data."
          destination: GOOGLE_OWNED_SERVICE
          internal {
            contacts {
                email: "chrome-safebrowsing@google.com"
            }
          }
          user_data {
            type: NONE
          }
          last_reviewed: "2023-01-01"
        }
        policy {
          cookies_allowed: YES
          cookies_store: "Safe Browsing cookie store"
          setting:
            "Users can disable Safe Browsing by unchecking 'Protect you and "
            "your device from dangerous sites' in Chromium settings under "
            "Privacy. The feature is enabled by default."
          chrome_policy {
            SafeBrowsingEnabled {
              policy_options {mode: MANDATORY}
              SafeBrowsingEnabled: false
            }
          }
        })");
```

#### Bad Examples
```cpp
  net::NetworkTrafficAnnotationTag bad_traffic_annotation =
      net::DefineNetworkTrafficAnnotation(
        ...
        trigger: "Chrome sends this when [obscure event that is not related to "
                 "anything user-perceivable]."
          // Please specify the exact user action that results in this request.
        data: "This sends everything the feature needs to know."
          // Please be precise, name the data items. If they are too many, name
          // the sensitive user data and general classes of other data and refer
          // to a document specifying the details.
        ...
        policy_exception_justification: "None."
          // Check again! Most features can be disabled or limited by a policy.
        ...
        })");
```

#### Empty Template
You can copy/paste the following template to define an annotation.
```cpp
  net::NetworkTrafficAnnotationTag traffic_annotation =
    net::DefineNetworkTrafficAnnotation("...", R"(
        semantics {
          sender: "..."
          description: "..."
          trigger: "..."
          data: "..."
          destination: WEBSITE/GOOGLE_OWNED_SERVICE/OTHER
        }
        policy {
          cookies_allowed: NO/YES
          cookies_store: "..."
          setting: "..."
          chrome_policy {
            [POLICY_NAME] {
                [POLICY_NAME]: ...
            }
          }
          policy_exception_justification = "..."
        }
        comments: "..."
      )");
```


## Testing for errors

There are several checks that should be done on annotations before submitting a
change list. These checks include:
* The annotations are syntactically correct.
* They have all required fields.
* Partial annotations and completing parts match (please refer to the next
  section).
* Annotations are not incorrectly defined.
   * e.g., traffic_annotation = NetworkTrafficAnnotation({1}).
* All usages from Chrome have annotation.
* That the annotation appears in
  `tools/traffic_annotation/summary/grouping.xml`. When adding a new annotation,
  it must also be included in `grouping.xml` for reporting purposes (please
  refer to the **Annotations Review**).


### Presubmit tests
To perform tests prior to submit, one can use the `auditor.py`
script. It runs over the whole repository, extracts
all the annotations from C++ code, and then checks them for correctness.

Running the `auditor.py` script requires a build directory in which you just
built the `chrome` target. You can invoke it like this:
`vpython3 tools/traffic_annotation/scripts/auditor/auditor.py
 --build-path=out/Default`

### Waterfall tests
Two commit queue trybots test traffic annotations on changed files using the
scripts in `tools/traffic_annotation/scripts`. To run these tests faster and to
avoid spamming the commit queue if an unforeseen error has happened in
downstream scripts or tools, they are run in error resilient mode, only on
changed files, and using heuristics to decide which files to process.
An FYI bot runs more detailed tests on the whole repository and with different
switches, to make sure that the heuristics that trybot tests use and the limited
scope of tests have not neglected any issues.


## Annotations Review

Network traffic annotations require review before landing in code and this is
enforced through keeping a summary of annotations in
`tools/traffic_annotation/summary/annotations.xml`. Once a new annotation is added,
one is updated, or deleted, this file should also be updated. To update the
`annotations.xml` file automatically, one can run `auditor.py`
as specified in presubmit tests. But if it is not possible to do so (e.g., if
you are changing the code from an unsupported platform or you don’t have a
compiled build directory), the code can be submitted to the trybot and the test
on trybot will tell you the required modifications.

In order to help make external reports easier, annotation unique ids should be
mentioned in `tools/traffic_annotation/summary/grouping.xml`. Once a new
annotation is added, or a preexisting annotation's unique id changes, this file
should also be updated. When adding a new annotation, make sure it is placed
within an appropriate group of `grouping.xml`. In the rare case that none of
the groups are appropriate, one can create a new group for the annotation; the
arrangement of annotations and group names in `grouping.xml` may be later
updated by a technical writer to better coincide with the external reports.

## Partial Annotations (Advanced)

There are cases where the network traffic annotation cannot be fully specified
in one place. For example, in one place we know the trigger of a network request
and in another place we know the data that will be sent. In these cases, we
prefer that both parts of the annotation appear in context so that they are
updated if code changes. Partial annotations help splitting the network traffic
annotation into two pieces. In these cases, we call the first part, the partial
annotation, and the part the completes it, the completing annotation. Partial
annotations and completing annotations do not need to have all annotation
fields, but their composition should have all required fields.

### Defining a Partial Annotation
To define a partial annotation, one can use
`net::DefinePartialNetworkTrafficAnnotation` function. Besides the unique id and
annotation text, this function requires the unique id of the completing part.
For example, a partial annotation that only specifies the semantics part or a
request with unique id "omnibox_prefetch_image", and is completed later using an
annotation with unique id "bitmap_fetcher", can be defined as follows:

```cpp
  net::PartialNetworkTrafficAnnotationTag partial_traffic_annotation =
      net::DefinePartialNetworkTrafficAnnotation("omnibox_prefetch_image",
                                                 "bitmap_fetcher", R"(
        semantics {
          sender: "Omnibox"
          Description: "..."
          Trigger: "..."
          Data: "..."
          destination: WEBSITE
        })");
```

### Nx1 Partial Annotations
The cases where several partial annotations may be completed by one completing
annotation are called Nx1. This also matches where N=1. To define a completing
annotation for such cases, one can use net::CompleteNetworkTrafficAnnotation
function. This function receives a unique id, the annotation text, and a
`net::PartialNetworkTrafficAnnotationTag` object. Here is an example of a
completing part for the previous example:

```cpp
  net::NetworkTrafficAnnotationTag traffic_annotation =
      net::CompleteNetworkTrafficAnnotation("bitmap_fetcher",
                                            partial_traffic_annotation, R"(
              policy {
                cookies_allowed: YES
                cookies_store: "user"
                setting: "..."
                chrome_policy {...}
              })");
```

### 1xN Partial Annotations
There are cases where one partial traffic annotation may be completed by
different completing annotations. In these cases,
`net::BranchedCompleteNetworkTrafficAnnotation` function can be used. This
function has an extra argument that is common between all branches and is
referred to by the partial annotation. For the above examples, if there would be
two different ways of completing the received partial annotation, the following
the definition can be used:

```cpp
if (...) {
    return net::BranchedCompleteNetworkTrafficAnnotation(
        "bitmap_fetcher_type1", "bitmap_fetcher",
        partial_traffic_annotation, R"(
          policy {
            cookies_allowed: YES
            cookies_store: "user"
            setting: "..."
            chrome_policy {...}
          })");
  } else {
    return net::BranchedCompleteNetworkTrafficAnnotation(
        "bitmap_fetcher_type2", "bitmap_fetcher",
        partial_traffic_annotation, R"(
          policy {
            cookies_allowed: YES
            cookies_store: "system"
            setting: "..."
            chrome_policy {...}
          })");
```

Please refer to `tools/traffic_annotation/sample_traffic_annotation.cc` for more
detailed examples.


## Mutable Annotations (Advanced)

`net::NetworkTrafficAnnotationTag` and `net::PartialNetworkTrafficAnnotationTag`
are defined with constant internal argument(s), so that once they are created,
they cannot be modified. There are very few exceptions that may require
modification of the annotation value, like the ones used by mojo interfaces
where after serialization, the annotation object is first created, then receives
value. In these cases, `net::MutableNetworkTrafficAnnotationTag` and
`net::MutablePartialNetworkTrafficAnnotationTag` can be used which do not have
this limitation.

Mutable annotations have a run time check before being converted into normal
annotations to ensure their content is valid. Therefore it is suggested that
they would be used only if there is no other way around it. Use cases are
checked with `auditor.py` to ensure proper initialization values for the
mutable annotations.


## Mojo Interfaces (Advanced)

For serialization of network traffic annotation and partial network traffic
annotation tags, you can use the mutable mojo interfaces defined in
`/services/network/public/mojom`.
