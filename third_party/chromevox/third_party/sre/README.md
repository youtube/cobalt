# Speech Rule Engine

This project generates human-friendly readings appropriate for text-to-speech
playback given Math ML.

Chrome OS accessibility extensions e.g. ChromeVox, use it for this purpose.

The project also contains localizations for a large number of unicode codepoints
appropriate for tts reading.
