# Settings Components V2

- Contact: cros-settings@google.com
- Design doc: http://go/cros-settings-revamp-componentization-design-doc

## Objective
Create a foundation for efficient development and richer experiences in ChromeOS
Settings by leveraging a library of flexible and easy-to-use UI components.

These UI components aim to reduce custom HTML code and overall produce a
consistent and cohesive UI.

## Usage
These components should be the primary tools to build pages/subpages and
integrate new settings. These components seamless integrate with `prefs` but do
not require prefs to function properly. See the comments in the respective
component file for documentation and specific usage examples.

If a component does not meet your use-case, please contact the Settings team for
further guidance.
