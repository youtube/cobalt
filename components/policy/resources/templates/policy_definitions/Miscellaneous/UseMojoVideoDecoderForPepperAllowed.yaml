caption: Allow <ph name="PEPPER_NAME">Pepper</ph> to use a new decoder
  for hardware accelerated video decoding.
desc: |-
  This policy controls whether <ph name="PEPPER_NAME">Pepper</ph> plugins can
  use the new decoder to talk to hardware decoders instead of the legacy video
  decoder.

  The migration only affects internal implementation details and should not
  change any behavior. However, this policy can be used in case any PPAPI
  applications do not work as expected.

  When the policy is left unset or set to Enabled the browser will decide which
  implementation is used.
  When the policy is set to Disabled, the browser will use the old implementation
  until this policy expires.

  If you must use the policy, please file a bug on crbug.com explaining your
  use case and CC {andrescj, blundell, pmolinalopez, vasilyt}@chromium.org. The
  policy is scheduled to be offered through <ph
  name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 114, after which
  the old implementation will be removed.

  NOTE: Only newly-started renderer processes will reflect changes to this
  policy while the browser is running.
