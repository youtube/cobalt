arc_support: This policy can also be used to pin Android apps.
caption: List of pinned apps to show in the launcher
desc: |-
  Setting the policy fixes which application identifiers <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> shows as pinned apps in the launcher bar, and users can't change them.

  Specify Chrome apps by their ID, such as pjkljhegncpnkpknbcohdijeoejaedia;
  Android apps by their package name, such as com.google.android.gm;
  web apps by the URL used in <ph name="WEB_APP_INSTALL_FORCE_LIST_POLICY_NAME">WebAppInstallForceList</ph>, such as https://google.com/maps;
  System Web Apps by their snake case name, such as <ph name="PINNED_LAUNCHER_APPS_POLICY_SYSTEM_WEB_APP_EXAMPLE">camera</ph>.
  Isolated Web Apps by their web bundle ID, such as <ph name="PINNED_LAUNCHER_APPS_POLICY_ISOLATED_WEB_APP_EXAMPLE">egoxo6biqdjrk62rman4vvr5cbq2ozsyydig7jmdxcmohdob2ecaaaic</ph>.

  Leaving it unset lets users change the list of pinned apps in the launcher.
