[FAIL] Sanitizer must be primary interface of new Sanitizer({})
  assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "ReferenceError: Sanitizer is not defined"
[FAIL] Stringification of new Sanitizer({})
  assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "ReferenceError: Sanitizer is not defined"
[FAIL] Sanitizer interface: new Sanitizer({}) must inherit property "sanitize((DocumentFragment or Document))" with the proper type
  assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "ReferenceError: Sanitizer is not defined"
[FAIL] Sanitizer interface: calling sanitize((DocumentFragment or Document)) on new Sanitizer({}) with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "ReferenceError: Sanitizer is not defined"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
