// set to 0. We should only break phrases on whitespace; so for example,
// breaking *before* the comma in "a smooth, semi-solid foam" would not be
// allowed.
// 3. If, on the other hand, the first token is a "phrase end indicator" (such
// as a comma), we bump up its weight by `kPhraseEndWeightBump` to prefer
// breaking there. So breaking *after* a comma would be encouraged. Likewise if
// the second token is a phrase start indicator, such as an open bracket, we
// bump its weight by `kPhraseStartWeightBump`.
// 4. If the two adjacent tokens have the same head, the weight is set to 1.
// This is done because some tokens have many children, which causes individual
// tokens to become stranded.
