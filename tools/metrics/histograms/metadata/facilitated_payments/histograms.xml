    A Pix-specific histogram. Emits true when a likely Pix code is copied to the
    clipboard on any merchant webiste. A likely Pix code contains substring
    &quot;0014br.gov.bcb.pix&quot;, but this is logged before the merchant
    allowlist check, which could thereafter fail and not trigger a PIX FOP
    selector UI. [Trigger] User copies a likely Pix code to the clipboard.
    [Frequency] Logged once per Pix payflow. Pix payflow is triggered at most
    once per page load.

  <summary>
    Logs the overall latency for the Pix transaction as experienced by the user
    and breaks it down by the result of the transaction. The timer starts when
    the user copies the Pix code, and ends when Chrome receives the result of
    the transaction (which also coincides with all Chrome and platform UIs
    closing). The result is {Result}. [Frequency] Logged at most once per Pix
    payflow. Pix payflow is triggered at most once per page load. [Trigger] User
    copies the Pix code, goes through the steps to complete the transaction, and
    at the end Chrome receives the result of the transaction.

    Note: A `Succeeded` result doesn't indicate that the transaction was
    successful. It only means that the payments backend was contacted, and a
    response was received.
