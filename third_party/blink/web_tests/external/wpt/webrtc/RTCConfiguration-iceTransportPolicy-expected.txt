This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS new RTCPeerConnection() should have default iceTransportPolicy all

PASS new RTCPeerConnection({ iceTransportPolicy: 'all' }) should succeed
PASS new RTCPeerConnection({ iceTransportPolicy: 'relay' }) should succeed
PASS setConfiguration({ iceTransportPolicy: 'relay' }) with initial iceTransportPolicy all should succeed
PASS setConfiguration({ iceTransportPolicy: 'all' }) with initial iceTransportPolicy relay should succeed
PASS setConfiguration({}) with initial iceTransportPolicy relay should set new value to all
PASS new RTCPeerConnection(config) - with invalid iceTransportPolicy should throw TypeError

FAIL new RTCPeerConnection({ iceTransports: 'invalid' }) should have no effect Failed to construct 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to read the 'iceTransports' property from 'RTCConfiguration': The provided value 'invalid' is not a valid enum value of type RTCIceTransportPolicy.
FAIL new RTCPeerConnection({ iceTransports: null }) should have no effect Failed to construct 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to read the 'iceTransports' property from 'RTCConfiguration': The provided value 'null' is not a valid enum value of type RTCIceTransportPolicy.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
