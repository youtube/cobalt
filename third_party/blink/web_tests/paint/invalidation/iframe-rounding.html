<!-- The div within the iframe is at 0.5px from the iframe bounds, and the div containing the iframe is at 0.5px from the top-left of the screen.
This test checks that the latter 0.5px is rounded to 1 before being added to the 0.5px and then rounded up again to an invalidation rect. This is
because iframes are painted in rounded-int coordinates.
