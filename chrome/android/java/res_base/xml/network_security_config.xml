    <!-- We delegate the handling of HLS videos to Android MediaPlayer. Starting
    with Android P, the default value of isCleartextTrafficPermitted() is false.
    This breaks our usage of MediaPlayer. We have to explicitly set
    cleartextTrafficPermitted here to preserve functionality.
    See https://crbug.com/827265. See also MediaPlayerRenderer. -->
