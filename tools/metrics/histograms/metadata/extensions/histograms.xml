    The breakdown of extensions that make up the &quot;Other extension&quot;

    Reports whether a call to set a dynamic icon in the toolbar passed an icon
    considered visible by our icon analysis code.

    This replaces the previous stat, DynamicExtensionActionIconWasVisible, due
    to a change to our analysis algorithm. The new algorithm renders the icon
    against the toolbar background color and determines how visible the
    resulting pixels are.
