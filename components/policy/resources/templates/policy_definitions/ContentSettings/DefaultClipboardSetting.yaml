caption: Default clipboard setting
default: null
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to 2 blocks sites from using the clipboard site permission. Setting the policy to 3 or leaving it unset lets the user change the setting and decide if the clipboard APIs are available when a site wants to use one.

        This policy can be overridden for specific URL patterns using the <ph name="CLIPBOARD_ALLOWED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">ClipboardAllowedForUrls</ph> and <ph name="CLIPBOARD_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">ClipboardBlockedForUrls</ph> policies.

        This policy only affects clipboard operations controlled by the clipboard site permission, and does not affect sanitized clipboard writes or trusted copy and paste operations.
