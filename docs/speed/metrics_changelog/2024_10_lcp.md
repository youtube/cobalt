# Largest Contentful Paint Change in Chrome 130

## Exclude transparent text from LCP

When texts are transparent, and with no visible decorations like shadows,
and strokes, they should be not eligible for LCP. But previously they are. We
fixed this and did experiment to see if the fix would have impact on the LCP
metric.


Note: this experiment was first landed in Chrome 126:
[Exclude transparent text with decorations from being skipped for LCP](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5498955),
and was slowly rolled out.

## How does this affect a site's metrics?

We observed that this featureâ€™s impact on ecosystem metrics was minimal and not
statistically significant.

## When were users affected?

Launch was the week of Oct 21, 2024, when m130 was in stable, but a limited
number of early adopters might have seen this change as early as m126.
