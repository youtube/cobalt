// Renderer-initiated navigations can be canceled from the JS task it was
// initiated from, e.g. if the script runs window.stop() after initiating the
// navigation. See also https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3447 and
// https://crbug.com/763106 for more background.
//
// The renderer cancels navigation by triggering the disconnection of the
// NavigationClient interface used to start the navigation, eventually
// calling `NavigationRequest::OnRendererAbortedNavigation()`.
//
// Same-SiteInstanceGroup navigations used to use the same NavigationClient for
// starting and committing the navigation. This means even if a CommitNavigation
// IPC is in-flight at the time of navigation cancellation, the navigation can
// still get canceled. Also, since the same RenderFrame is reused, the
// CommitNavigation IPC also implicitly waits for the JS task that triggers the
// navigation to finish, as the commit can't be processed before then.
//
// However, with RenderDocument, the RenderFrame and NavigationClient won't be
// reused, which means navigation cancellations might only affect navigations
// that haven't entered READY_TO_COMMIT stage.
//
// RendererCancellationThrottle helps preserve the previous behavior by waiting
// for the JS task to finish, through deferring the navigation before it gets
// into the READY_TO_COMMIT stage, until the renderer that started the
// navigation sends the `NavigationCancellationWindowEnded` IPC that corresponds
// to the navigation, signifying that the JS task that initiated the navigation
// had ended and no renderer-initiated navigation cancellations can happen after
// that point.
