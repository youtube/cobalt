This directory contains all the SVG icons used by Recorder App.

Ideally the SVG files should be the original 20x20 icon, optimized via SVGOMG.

[//]: # (TODO(pihsun): Change it to our own team site)

Icons in go/ea-icons are added similarly with the ic_ prefix removed.

List of icons that are exported from figma:
* close.svg
* laptop_chromebook.svg
* mic_external_on.svg
* remove_fill.svg

[//]: # (TODO(pihsun): Check / update all SVG to the file from the designer,
and check file names)
