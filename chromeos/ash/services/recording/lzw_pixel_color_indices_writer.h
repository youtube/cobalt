// Background: After color quantization is performed on the video frame, we end
// up with:
// 1- A color table (or a color palette) that contains a list of colors (up to
//    256 colors) that can best represent all the colors in the video frame.
// 2- A list of indices (`pixel_color_indices`), which defines a mapping between
//    each pixel in the video frame and an index of a color in the above
//    mentioned color palette. Pixels are processed from left to right and from
//    top to bottom.
// If we try to write these pixel indices as they are to the GIF file, that
// could be a huge waste of space (magine an animated GIF image of size 1920 x
// 1080, this means we would write (1920 x 1080 = 2073600) indices for each
// video frame.
// In order to solve this problem, GIF uses the Variable-Length-Code Lempel-Ziv-
// Welch (LZW) compression algorithm, which tries to take advantage of the fact
// that many neighboring pixels may share the same color, and therefore, itâ€™s
// possible to use special codes to indicate a sequence of colors, rather than
// one color at a time.
// To have even more compression when writing those LZW codes to the file, the
// GIF specs employs the Variable-Length-Code aspect of the algorithm as
// follows:
// - The number of bits needed to represent the currently used compression codes
//   is tracked as `current_code_bit_size` (see .cc file).
// - Instead of writing whole bytes for these codes to the file, we write only
//   the bits needed to represent them using the `current_code_bit_size`. These
//   bits are packages in a byte stream and eventually get written to the file.
// - As we add new codes, when the new number of codes exceeds what's currently
//   representable by `current_code_bit_size`, we increment it by one.
//
// This class implements the GIF LZW compression of a given
// `pixel_color_indices`, and takes care of writing the output to the GIF file
// using the given `gif_file_writer`.
