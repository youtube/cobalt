This directory contains Dromaeo, a JavaScript and DOM performance benchmark.

Dromaeo was developed and released by John Resig (jresig at mozilla.com)/

This benchmark was slightly modified to: 
 - Enable Chromium automation.
 - Avoid grabbing javascript libraries from the Web.


How to update:

0) remove all the files from this dir, but keep README.chromium and LICENSE.
1) pull new version from git://github.com/antonm/dromaeo.git into a separate
directory.
2) run 'make web' to build standalone version.
3) copy all the files from web dir into this directory.
4) apply patches in patches dir.
5) Update javascript libraries to those refered in upstream (and not updated)
   in lib/.
