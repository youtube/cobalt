// Lock for an AccessHandle created by the renderer.

// The interface is consumed by Blink in the renderer process. The interface is
// currently implemented in the browser process, and will eventually move to the
// Storage Service.
//
// This interface currently serves as a lock. The renderer gets access to the
// associated file while it keeps this interface's mojo pipe open.

  // allows the browser to release the lock held on the owning
  // FileSystemFileHandle.
  //
  // Well-behaved renderers will call this method after closing the associated
  // file descriptor received by the
  // FileSystemAccessFileHandle.OpenAccessHandle().
  //
  // A compromised renderer may lie and call this method without closing its
  // corresponding file descriptor. This may allow it to observe writes from
  // other renderers to the same (origin-scoped) file, so no cross-origin data
  // would be leaked.
