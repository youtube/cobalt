# Crash

Crash is a [layered component](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/layered-components-design/)
to enable it to be shared cleanly on iOS.

## Debugging

### Breakpad (iOS)

iOS crash reporting uses Breakpad. Some [code changes](http://crrev.com/c/1570168) are necessary in order
to enable crash reporting in local debug builds.
