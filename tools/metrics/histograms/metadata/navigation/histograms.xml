    When we are attempting to activate a prerendered page, we compare the

    PrerenderHost will post a task. The task scans the two headers, and will
    report a mismatching record if it detects any differences between them. It
    records the hashed number of a mismatching header, together with the
    mismatching reason: Missing in prerendering navigation, missing in
    activation navigation, or the values mismatch.

  <summary>
    This histogram tracks the interfaces that
    Prerender.Experimental.PrerenderCancelledInterface fails to track. It is
    needed because:

    * Embedders can set their own policies, so Prerender2 cannot map all of them
    to enums.

    * Channel-associated interfaces' policies are set to kCancel implicitly.
    It's hard to track all of them, especially the newly added
    channel-associated interfaces.

    This sparse histogram allows Prerender2 to record all of these interfaces
    separately.

    It is recored by MojoBinderPolicyApplier in the browser process once it
    receives the binding request of a kCancel Mojo interface and cannot find an
    accurate enum type for this interface.

    A breakdown metric for analyzing cross-origin redirection cases during

    prerendering was redirected to another origin that differs from the initial
    one.

    The cases are encoded into 3 bits(scheme mismatch, host mismatch, port
    mismatch).

    Note that for now it is not used for prerendering that are triggered by
    speculation rules.

  <summary>
    PrerenderManager records the duration period from the time to start
    prerendering with the search hints to the time to navigate the search hints.
    This duration is recorded when it finds the search hints predicts correctly,
    e.g. users do search and results in activating the prerendered page, or
    users do saerch the prerender hints but the prerendered page has been
    destroyed due to expiration.

    |====== HitFinishedSearchResultLifeTime=======|

    @ Timestamp X ------------------------------- @ Timestamp Y

    or

    |====== HitFinishedSearchResultLifeTime=============|

    @ Timestamp X ------------------------------------- @ Timestamp Z

    Where:

    * Timestamp X: Chrome receives the first prerender hints for a search term
    A.

    * Timestamp Y: User selects the search term A.

    * Timestamp Z: Timestamp X + Fixed period T.

    HitFinishedSearchResultLifeTime = min(Timestamp Y, Timestamp Z) - Timestamp
    X = min(Timestamp Y - Timestamp X, T).

    It aims to:

    1. Track the prerenders which were canceled due to expiration(Fixed period
    T).

    2. Gain the understanding of the duration between the moment when browser
    receives the first prerender hint and the moment when the hint is selected.
    This data will be used to determine the threshold of deciding whether to
    reuse a prefetched response or to resend a prefetch request.

    Recorded by StreamingSearchPrefetchURLLoader in its destructor. This
    instance is created per (non-duplicated) prefetch attempt. The destructor
    runs upon:

    - Case 1: A prefetched response is deleted upon expiration or network error.

    - Case 2: A prefetched response deletes itself after finishing serving to
    navigations. This will be executed asynchronously.

    See comments in StreamingSearchPrefetchURLLoader for more information.

    Indicates the number of prerendering DSE navigation that one prefetched
    response served to. In most cases, it should record 0 (which means the
    loader does not serve to any prerendering navigations) or 1 (served to one
    prerender). And we will track the count that is greater than 2 to determine
    whether the loader should be designed to target multiple serving
    destinations.

    This number should be quite small (0 or 1 in most cases), so the count is
    capped at 9 and put into 10 buckets, from 0 to 9.
