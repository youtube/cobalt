caption: Automatically select client certificates for these sites
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets you make a list of URL patterns that specify sites for which Chrome can automatically select a client certificate. The value is an array of stringified JSON dictionaries, each with the form <ph name="AUTO_SELECT_CERTIFICATE_FOR_URLS_EXAMPLE">{ "pattern": "$URL_PATTERN", "filter" : $FILTER }</ph>, where <ph name="URL_PATTERN_PLACEHOLDER">$URL_PATTERN</ph> is a content setting pattern. <ph name="FILTER_PLACEHOLDER">$FILTER</ph> restricts the client certificates the browser automatically selects from. Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

        Examples for the usage of the <ph name="FILTER_PLACEHOLDER">$FILTER</ph> section:

        * When <ph name="FILTER_PLACEHOLDER">$FILTER</ph> is set to <ph name="AUTO_SELECT_CERTIFICATE_FOR_URLS_FILTER_EXAMPLE">{ "ISSUER": { "CN": "$ISSUER_CN" } }</ph>, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName <ph name="ISSUER_CN_PLACEHOLDER">$ISSUER_CN</ph> are selected.

        * When <ph name="FILTER_PLACEHOLDER">$FILTER</ph> contains both the <ph name="ISSUER_STRING_VALUE">"ISSUER"</ph> and the <ph name="SUBJECT_STRING_VALUE">"SUBJECT"</ph> sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

        * When <ph name="FILTER_PLACEHOLDER">$FILTER</ph> contains a <ph name="SUBJECT_STRING_VALUE">"SUBJECT"</ph> section with the <ph name="FILTER_STRING_ORGANIZATION">"O"</ph> value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

        * When <ph name="FILTER_PLACEHOLDER">$FILTER</ph> contains a <ph name="SUBJECT_STRING_VALUE">"SUBJECT"</ph> section with a <ph name="FILTER_STRING_ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT">"OU"</ph> value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

        * When <ph name="FILTER_PLACEHOLDER">$FILTER</ph> is set to <ph name="EMPTY_DICTIONARY">{}</ph>, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.

        Leaving the policy unset means there's no autoselection for any site.
