caption: Control whether passkey creation will default to iCloud Keychain.
desc: |-
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> may direct
  passkey/WebAuthn creation requests directly to iCloud Keychain on macOS 13.5
  or later. If iCloud Keychain syncing has not been enabled yet, this will
  prompt the user to sign in with iCloud, or may prompt them to enable iCloud
  Keychain syncing.

  If this policy is set to false, iCloud Keychain will not be used by default
  and the previous behavior (of creating the credential in the <ph
  name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> profile) may be used
  instead. Users will still be able to select iCloud Keychain as an option, and
  may still see iCloud Keychain credentials when signing in.

  If this policy is set to "true" then iCloud Keychain will be the default
  whenever the WebAuthn request is compatible with that choice.

  If this policy is not set then the default depends on factors such as
  whether iCloud Drive is enabled, and whether the user has recently used or
  created a credential in their
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> profile.
