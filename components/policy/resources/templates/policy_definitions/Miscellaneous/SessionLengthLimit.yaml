caption: Limit the length of a user session
desc: |-
  When this policy is set, it specifies the length of time after which a user is automatically logged out, terminating the session. The user is informed about the remaining time by a countdown timer shown in the system tray.

        When this policy is not set, the session length is not limited.

        If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

        The policy value should be specified in milliseconds. Values are clamped to a range of 30 seconds to 24 hours.
