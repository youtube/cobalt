// The following test works by loading a page over HTTPS, which requests a
// resource over HTTP when the document has the default referrer policy
// (interpreted as no-referrer-when-downgrade). After the request is
// prepared/made, the document's referrer policy is set to 'origin'. The test
// asserts that the referrer associated with the request when the document's
// referrer policy was no-referrer-when-downgrade is empty, and not the origin.
// This test is similar to
// referrer-policy-conflicting-policies-{font-face,image-set}.html
