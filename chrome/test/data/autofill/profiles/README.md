profiles.json contains descriptions of fully-structured profiles intended for
manual testing. They can be imported using the following command line flag:
--autofill-profiles-for-manual-testing=path/to/profiles.json
This overwrites all existing profiles permanently. It is therefore
recommended to use a temporary --user-data-dir=/tmp/...
