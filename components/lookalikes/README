This directory contains shared code related to Chrome's lookalike warnings.

If Chrome believes a site a user is visiting is a lookalike URL, Chrome may
warn users about this state. This warning may either be a full-page interstitial
warning or a pop-up while visiting the page.

These warnings will not trigger on sites that are not likely to be actively
malicious, such as popular sites or sites with high engagement scores.

See docs/security/lookalikes/lookalike-domains.md for details.
