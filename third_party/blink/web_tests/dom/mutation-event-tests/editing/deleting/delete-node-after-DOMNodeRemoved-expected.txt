CONSOLE WARNING: Listener added for a synchronous 'DOMNodeRemoved' DOM Mutation Event. This event type is deprecated (https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#legacy-event-types) and work is underway to remove it from this browser. Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a risk of future incompatibility. Consider using MutationObserver instead.
This tests for a bug where delete would crash if a node just after the selection to delete is removed in a DOMNodeRemoved event handler for the last node in the selection to delete. <rdar://problem/5156801>
