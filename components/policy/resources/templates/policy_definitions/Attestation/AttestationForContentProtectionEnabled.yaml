caption: Enable the use of remote attestation for content protection for the device
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> devices use remote attestation (Verified Access) to get a certificate issued by the <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> CA that asserts the device is eligible to play protected content. This process involves sending hardware endorsement information to the <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> CA which uniquely identifies the device.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means the device won't use remote attestation for content protection, and the device may not play protected content.
