caption: Screen lock delay when running on battery power
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Note that this policy is deprecated and will be removed in <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> version 85. Please use <ph name="SCREEN_LOCK_DELAYS_POLICY_NAME">ScreenLockDelays</ph> instead.

            Specifies the length of time without user input after which the screen is locked when running on battery power.

            When this policy is set to a value greater than zero, it specifies the length of time that the user must remain idle before <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> locks the screen.

            When this policy is set to zero, <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> does not lock the screen when the user becomes idle.

            When this policy is unset, a default length of time is used.

            The recommended way to lock the screen on idle is to enable screen locking on suspend and have <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> suspend after the idle delay. This policy should only be used when screen locking should occur a significant amount of time sooner than suspend or when suspend on idle is not desired at all.

            The policy value should be specified in milliseconds. Values are clamped to be less than the idle delay.
