caption: Enable smart dim model to extend the time until the screen is dimmed
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset turns the smart dim model on and can extend the time until the screen dims. If it delays the time, the screen off, screen lock, and idle delays adjust to maintain the same distances from the screen dim delay as originally set.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means the smart dim model won't influence screen dimming.
