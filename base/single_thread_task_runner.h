// thread.  Most use cases require only a SequencedTaskRunner, unless
// there is a specific need to run tasks on only a single thread.
//
// SingleThreadTaskRunner implementations might:
//   - Post tasks to an existing thread's MessageLoop (see
//     MessageLoop::task_runner()).
//   - Create their own worker thread and MessageLoop to post tasks to.
//   - Add tasks to a FIFO and signal to a non-MessageLoop thread for them to
//     be processed. This allows TaskRunner-oriented code run on threads
//     running other kinds of message loop, e.g. Jingle threads.
