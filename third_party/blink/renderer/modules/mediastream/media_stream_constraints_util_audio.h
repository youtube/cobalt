// while processing constraints.

// This function implements the SelectSettings algorithm for audio tracks as
// described in https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dfn-selectsettings
// The algorithm starts with a set containing all possible candidate settings
// based on system/hardware capabilities (passed via the |capabilities|
// parameter) and supported values for properties not involved in device
// selection. Candidates that do not support the basic constraint set from
// |constraints| are removed. If the set of candidates is empty after this step,
// the function returns an AudioCaptureSettings object without value and whose
// failed_constraint_name() method returns the name of one of the (possibly
// many) constraints that could not be satisfied or an empty string if the set
// of candidates was initially empty (e.g., if there are no devices in the
// system). After the basic constraint set is applied, advanced constraint sets
// are applied. If no candidates can satisfy an advanced set, the advanced set
// is ignored, otherwise the candidates that cannot satisfy the advanced set are
// removed.
// Once all constraint sets are applied, the result is selected from the
// remaining candidates by giving preference to candidates closest to the ideal
// values specified in the basic constraint set, or using default
// implementation-specific values.
// The result includes the following properties:
//  * Device. A device can be chosen using the device_id constraint.
//    For device capture, the validity of device IDs is checked by
//    SelectSettings since the list of allowed device IDs is known in advance.
//    For content capture, all device IDs are considered valid by
//    SelectSettings. Actual validation is performed by the getUserMedia
//    implementation.
//  * Audio features: the disable_local_echo and render_to_associated_sink
//    constraints can be used to enable the corresponding audio feature. If not
//    specified, their default value is false, except for disable_local_echo,
//    whose default value is false only for desktop capture.
//  * Audio processing. The remaining constraints are used to control audio
//    processing. This is how audio-processing properties are set for device
//    capture(see the blink::AudioProcessingProperties struct) :
//      - echo_cancellation_type: mapped from the experimental constraint with
//        the same name. "System" is selected only if the device supports it.
//        If constraint is not specified, "system" is selected if supported,
//        with exception for experimental system echo cancellation.
//      - goog_audio_mirroring: This property is mapped directly from the final
//        value of the goog_audio_mirroring constraint. If no value is
//        explicitly specified, the default value is false.
//    The remaining audio-processing properties are directly mapped from the
//    final value of the corresponding constraints. If no value is explicitly
//    specified, the default value is the same as the final value of the
//    echo_cancellation constraint.  If the echo_cancellation constraint is
//    not explicitly specified, the default value is implementation defined
//    (see blink::AudioProcessingProperties).
//    For content capture the rules are the same, but all properties are false
//    by default, regardless of the value of the echo_cancellation constraint.
//    Note that it is important to distinguish between audio properties and
//    constraints. Constraints are an input to SelectSettings, while properties
//    are part of the output. The value for most boolean properties comes
//    directly from a corresponding boolean constraint, but this is not true for
//    all constraints and properties. For example, the echo_cancellation and
//    goog_echo_cancellation constraints  are not directly mapped to any
//    property, but they, together with hardware characteristics, influence the
//    selection of echo cancellation type.
//    Moreover, the echo_cancellation constraint influences most other
//    audio-processing properties for which no explicit value is provided in
//    their corresponding constraints.
// |is_reconfiguration_allowed| indicates whether it is possible to reconfigure
// settings on an open audio track.
// TODO(crbug.com/796964): remove |is_reconfiguration_allowed| when both
// getUserMedia and applyConstraints code paths allow for reconfiguration.
