// Note: before adding a new `WebContentsObserver` subclass, consider if simpler
// helpers will suffice:
//
// - Classes that have a 1:1 relationship with one RenderFrameHost can often
//   use `DocumentUserData` instead.
// - Mojo interface implementations that have a 1 RenderFrameHost to many
//   instances relationship can often use `DocumentService` instead.
// - `base::WeakPtr<WebContents>` and `WeakDocumentPtr` can be used instead of
//   manually clearing raw ptrs using observer methods like
//   `WebContentsDestroyed` or `RenderFrameDeleted`. Similarly, don't create a
//   `WebContentsObserver` just to be able to check for a null
//   `WebContentsObserver::web_contents()`. Use a `base::WeakPtr<WebContents>`
//   instead.
//
// These helpers can help avoid memory safety bugs, such as retaining a pointer
// to a deleted RenderFrameHost, or other security issues, such as origin
// confusion when a RenderFrameHost is reused after a cross-document navigation.

// An observer API implemented by classes which are interested in various page
// events from WebContents.  They also get a chance to filter IPC messages.
// The difference between WebContentsDelegate (WCD) and WebContentsObserver
// (WCO) is that there is one WCD per WebContents and many WCOs. Methods which
// have a return value, e.g. are expected to change state, should be on WCD.
//
// Since a WebContents can be a delegate to almost arbitrarily many
// RenderViewHosts, it is important to check in those WebContentsObserver
// methods which take a RenderViewHost that the event came from the
// RenderViewHost the observer cares about.
//
// Usually, observers should only care about the current RenderViewHost as
// returned by GetRenderViewHost().

  // the lifecycle state of the RenderFrameHosts. Consider using
  // |RenderFrameHostStateChanged|.

  // (WebContents::GetPrimaryPage()) changes to `page`. This happens in one of
  // the following cases:
  // 1) when the current RenderFrameHost in the primary main frame changes after
  //    a navigation.
  // 2) when the current RenderFrameHost in the primary main frame is
  //    reinitialized after a crash.

  // one (back-forward cache restore or prerendering activation).

  // This notification is not dispatched for changes of pages in the non-primary
  // frame trees (prerendering, fenced frames) and when the primary page is
  // destroyed (e.g., when closing a tab).

  // that it changes to is |new_state|. |old_state| and |new_state| are always
  // different, i.e., a frame can't transition to the same state.
  //
  // This method allows code to react to RenderFrameHost LifecycleState changes.
  // For example, to detect changes in the currently active document and perform
  // different actions accordingly, like closing UI/resetting states,
  // RenderFrameHostStateChanged is preferred instead of DidFinishNavigation.
  // DidFinishNavigation does not guarantee that the old document will go away.
  // Instead, it could enter the BackForwardCache and then become kActive later.

  // DidRedirectNavigation, DidFinishNavigation, and ReadyToCommitNavigation
  // when related to this navigation. Observers should clear any references to
  // `navigation_handle` in DidFinishNavigation, just before it is destroyed.
  //
  // IMPORTANT NOTES:
  // - Starting a navigation doesn't affect which document is shown, or
  // (in many cases) which URL is displayed in the omnibox. Most effects of the
  // navigation only occur at DidFinishNavigation, if it commits. Feature code
  // generally should not use DidStartNavigation to reset their state (e.g.
  // close the UI), especially given that a renderer process can easily start a
  // navigation which is guaranteed not to commit (e.g. by navigating to
  // a URL returning a response with HTTP status code of 204 or a download).
  // Consider listening to PrimaryPageChanged or DidFinishNavigation instead.
  //
  // - This notification is fired by navigations in any frame of the
  // WebContents, not just the primary main frame.
  //
  // - This notification is fired by same-document navigations, such as fragment
  // navigations or pushState/replaceState, which will not result in a document
  // change. To filter these out, use NavigationHandle::IsSameDocument.
  //
  // - There can be more than one navigation ongoing in the same frame at the
  // same time (including the main frame). Each will get its own
  // NavigationHandle.
  //
  // - There is no guarantee that DidFinishNavigation will be called
  // for any particular navigation before DidStartNavigation is called on the
  // next.
  //
  // TODO(creis, mcnee): Consider renaming this method to better indicate its
  // semantics (e.g. DidStartNavigationAttempt).
  //
  // WARNING: Please read the above IMPORTANT NOTES for correct usage.
  virtual void DidStartNavigation(NavigationHandle* navigation_handle) {}

  // the request is successful but there's no content that follows) or a
  // download (either from a response header or based on mime sniffing the
  // response). The browser then is ready to switch rendering the new document.
  // Most observers should use DidFinishNavigation instead, which happens right
  // after the navigation commits. This method is for observers that want to
