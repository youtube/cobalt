This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] ":has(:is(:has(*)))" should be a valid selector
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected ":has(:is(:has(*)))" but got ":has(:is())"
[FAIL] ":has(:where(:has(*)))" should be a valid selector
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected ":has(:where(:has(*)))" but got ":has(:where())"
[FAIL] ":has(:is(.a, 123))" should be a valid selector
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected ":has(:is(.a, 123))" but got ":has(:is(.a))"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
