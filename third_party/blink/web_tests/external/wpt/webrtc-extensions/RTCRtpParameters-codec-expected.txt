[PASS] Setting codec on an audio sender with setParameters should work
[PASS] Setting codec on a video sender with setParameters should work
[PASS] Creating an audio sender with addTransceiver and non-existing codec should throw OperationError
[PASS] Creating an audio sender with addTransceiver and non-existing codec type should throw OperationError
[PASS] Creating a video sender with addTransceiver and non-existing codec should throw OperationError
[PASS] Creating a video sender with addTransceiver and non-existing codec type should throw OperationError
[PASS] Setting a non-existing codec on an audio sender with setParameters should throw InvalidModificationError
[PASS] Setting a non-existing codec on a video sender with setParameters should throw InvalidModificationError
[PASS] Setting a non-preferred codec on an audio sender with setParameters should throw InvalidModificationError
[PASS] Setting a non-preferred codec on a video sender with setParameters should throw InvalidModificationError
[PASS] Setting a non-negotiated codec on an audio sender with setParameters should throw InvalidModificationError
[PASS] Setting a non-negotiated codec on a video sender with setParameters should throw InvalidModificationError
[PASS] Codec should be undefined after negotiating away the currently set codec on an audio sender
[PASS] Codec should be undefined after negotiating away the currently set codec on a video sender
[PASS] Stats output-rtp should match the selected codec in non-simulcast usecase on an audio sender
[PASS] Stats output-rtp should match the selected codec in non-simulcast usecase on a video sender
[PASS] Stats output-rtp should match the selected codec in simulcast usecase on a video sender
[FAIL] Stats output-rtp should match the selected mixed codecs in simulcast usecase on a video sender
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setParameters' on 'RTCRtpSender': Attempted to use different codec values for different encodings."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
