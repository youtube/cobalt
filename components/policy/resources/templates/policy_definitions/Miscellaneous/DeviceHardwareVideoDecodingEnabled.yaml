caption: Enable GPU hardware video decoding

desc: |-
  If this policy is unset or set to true, video decoding will be hardware-accelerated where available.

  If this policy is set to false, video decoding will never be hardware-accelerated.

  Disabling hardware-accelerated video decoding is not advised since it will result in a higher CPU load which in turn will negatively affect device performance and battery consumption.
