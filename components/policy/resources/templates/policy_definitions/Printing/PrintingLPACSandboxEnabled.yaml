caption: Enable Printing LPAC Sandbox
default: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset enables the LPAC Sandbox for printing services whenever the system configuration supports it.

  Setting the policy to Disabled has a detrimental effect on <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>'s security as services used for printing might run in a weaker sandbox configuration.

  Only turn off the policy if there are compatibility issues with third party software that prevent printing services from operating correctly inside the LPAC Sandbox.
