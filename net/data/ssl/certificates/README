- google.single.der
- google.single.pem
- thawte.single.pem : Certificates for testing parsing of different formats.

- mit.davidben.der : An expired MIT client certificate.

- foaf.me.chromium-test-cert.der : A client certificate for a FOAF.ME identity
     created for testing.

- www_us_army_mil_cert.der
- dod_ca_17_cert.der
- dod_root_ca_2_cert.der : A certificate chain for regression tests of
     http://crbug.com/31497.

- expired_cert.pem : An expired certificate, used by test_server.cc.

- ok_cert.pem : A valid certificate, used by test_server.cc

- root_ca_cert.crt : The testing root CA used to sign the test_server.cc's
     certificates.

- unosoft_hu_cert : Certificate used by X509CertificateTest.UnoSoftCertParsing.

- client.p12 : A PKCS #12 file containing a client certificate and a private
     key created for testing.  The password is "12345".

- client-nokey.p12 : A PKCS #12 file containing a client certificate (the same
     as the one in client.p12) but no private key. The password is "12345".

- punycodetest.der : A test self-signed server certificate with punycode name.
     The common name is "xn--wgv71a119e.com" (日本語.com)

- unittest.selfsigned.der : A self-signed certificate generated using private
     key in unittest.key.bin. The common name is "unittest".

- unittest.key.bin : private key stored unencrypted.

- x509_verify_results.chain.pem : A simple certificate chain used to test that
    the correctly ordered, filtered certificate chain is returned during
    verification, regardless of the order in which the intermediate/root CA
    certificates are provided.

- google_diginotar.pem
- diginotar_public_ca_2025.pem : A certificate chain for the regression test
      of http://crbug.com/94673

- test_mail_google_com.pem : A certificate signed by the test CA for
    "mail.google.com". Because it is signed by that CA instead of the true CA
    for that host, it will fail the
    TransportSecurityState::IsChainOfPublicKeysPermitted test.

- salesforce_com_test.pem
- verisign_intermediate_ca_2011.pem
- verisign_intermediate_ca_2016.pem : Certificates for testing two
     X509Certificate objects that contain the same server certificate but
     different intermediate CA certificates.  The two intermediate CA
     certificates actually represent the same intermediate CA but have
     different validity periods.

- multivalue_rdn.pem : A regression test for http://crbug.com/101009. A
     certificate with all of the AttributeTypeAndValues stored within a single
     RelativeDistinguishedName, rather than one AVA per RDN as normally seen.

- unescaped.pem : Regression test for http://crbug.com/102839. Contains
     characters such as '=' and '"' that would normally be escaped when
     converting a subject/issuer name to their stringized form.
