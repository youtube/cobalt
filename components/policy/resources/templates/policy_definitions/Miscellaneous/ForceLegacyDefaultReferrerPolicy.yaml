caption: Use a default referrer policy of no-referrer-when-downgrade.
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This enterprise policy is for short-term adaptation and will be removed in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 88.

        Chrome's default referrer policy is being strengthened from its current value of no-referrer-when-downgrade to the more secure strict-origin-when-cross-origin through a gradual rollout targeting Chrome 85 stable.

        Before the rollout, this enterprise policy will have no effect. After the rollout, when this enterprise policy is enabled, Chrome's default referrer policy will be set to its previous value of no-referrer-when-downgrade.

        This enterprise policy is disabled by default.
