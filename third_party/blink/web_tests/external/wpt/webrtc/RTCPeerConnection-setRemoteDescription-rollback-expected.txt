This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS setRemoteDescription(rollback) in have-remote-offer state should revert to stable state
PASS setRemoteDescription(rollback) from stable state should reject with InvalidStateError
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) after setting a local offer should reject with InvalidStateError assert_unreached: Should have rejected: undefined Reached unreachable code
PASS setRemoteDescription(rollback) should ignore invalid sdp content and succeed
PASS local offer created before setRemoteDescription(remote offer) then rollback should still be usable
PASS local offer created before setRemoteDescription(remote offer) with different transceiver level assignments then rollback should still be usable
PASS rollback of a remote offer should remove a transceiver
PASS rollback of a remote offer should remove touched transceiver
PASS rollback of a remote offer should keep a transceiver
PASS rollback of a remote offer should keep a transceiver created by addtrack
PASS rollback of a remote offer should keep a transceiver without tracks
PASS explicit rollback of local offer should remove transceivers and transport
PASS when using addTransceiver, implicit rollback of a local offer should visit stable state, but not fire negotiationneeded until we settle in stable
PASS when using addTrack, implicit rollback of a local offer should visit stable state, but not fire negotiationneeded
PASS rollback of a remote offer to negotiated stable state should enable applying of a local offer
PASS rollback of a local offer to negotiated stable state should enable applying of a remote offer
PASS rollback a local offer with audio direction change to negotiated stable state and then add video receiver
PASS two transceivers with same mids
PASS onremovetrack fires during remote rollback
PASS rollback of a remote offer with stream changes
PASS removeTrack() with a sender being rolled back does not crash or throw
PASS Implicit rollback with only a datachannel works
Harness: the test ran to completion.
