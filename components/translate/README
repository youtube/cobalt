- translate/language detection depends on the CLD library and should only be
used from the renderer to avoid bloating the DLLs on Windows.

- Translate is in the process of becoming a layered component
(https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/design-documents/layered-components-design)
to enable it to be shared cleanly on iOS.

When this process is complete, this component will have the following structure:

core/: shared code that does not depend on src/content/ or src/ios/
  browser/: Browser process code
  common/: Code shared by the browser and the renderer
  language_detection/: Language detection code, only used from the renderer on
                       all platforms but iOS (where it is used from the browser)
content/: Driver for the shared code based on the content layer.
  browser/: Browser process code.
  renderer/: Renderer process code.
  common/: Code shared by the browser and the renderer.
ios/: Driver for the shared code based on src/ios.
