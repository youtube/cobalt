// base::FilePath uses 8 bit characters this directly contains those
// characters, and on platforms where base::FilePath uses 16 bit characters
// those characters are serialized using the current platform's endianness.
// This means paths can't necesarilly be read back on different platforms
// or computers from where they were written, but since the path references
// something on the local device that likely doesn't exist on a different
// computer anyway this should be no problem in practice.
