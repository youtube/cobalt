caption: Action to take when the idle delay is reached while running on AC power
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Note that this policy is deprecated and will be removed in <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> version 85. Please use <ph name="POWER_MANAGEMENT_IDLE_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">PowerManagementIdleSettings</ph> instead.

            When this policy is set, it specifies the action that <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> takes when the user remains idle for the length of time given by the idle delay, which can be configured separately.

            When this policy is unset, the default action is taken, which is suspend.

            If the action is suspend, <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> can separately be configured to either lock or not lock the screen before suspending.
