This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] generateKeyFrame() throws for audio
  assert_equals: Message: transformer.generateKeyFrame is not a function expected "InvalidStateError" but got "TypeError"
[FAIL] generateKeyFrame(null) resolves for video sender, and throws for video receiver
  assert_equals: expected "success" but got "failure"
[FAIL] generateKeyFrame throws NotAllowedError for invalid rid
  assert_equals: Message: transformer.generateKeyFrame is not a function expected "NotAllowedError" but got "TypeError"
[FAIL] generateKeyFrame throws NotFoundError for unknown rid
  assert_equals: Message: transformer.generateKeyFrame is not a function expected "NotFoundError" but got "TypeError"
[FAIL] generateKeyFrame throws for unset transforms
  assert_equals: expected "success" but got "failure"
[FAIL] generateKeyFrame timestamp should advance
  assert_equals: expected "success" but got "failure"
[FAIL] await generateKeyFrame, await generateKeyFrame should see an increase in count of keyframes
  assert_equals: expected "success" but got "failure"
[FAIL] generateKeyFrame rejects when the sender is negotiated inactive, and resumes succeeding when negotiated back to active
  assert_equals: expected "success" but got "failure"
[FAIL] generateKeyFrame rejects when the sender is stopped, even without negotiation
  assert_equals: expected "success" but got "failure"
[FAIL] generateKeyFrame rejects with a null track
