# visibility.

# TODO(danakj): Rust exports everything on posix, since that is the default
# behaviour and it has equivalent to Clang's `-fvisibility=hidden`. If and
# when Rust grows that capability, we should use it, and then we can remove
# this exports file, since only explicitly exported things should appear
# in the library.
#
# TODO(crbug.com/1462356): However there's also a second issue that #[no_mangle]
# symbols get exported, which will need to be resolved too.
