caption: Specifies URLs that allow legacy technology report
default: []
desc: |-
  Controls if a page that use legacy technologies will be reported based on its URL.

  When policy is set, the URLs whose prefix match an allowlist entry will be used to generated report and uploaded. Unmatched URLs will be ignored.
  When policy is not set or set to an empty list, no report will be generated.

  The matching patterns use a similar format to those for the '<ph name="URL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">URLBlocklist</ph>' policy, which are documented at https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format. With a few exceptions below:
   * No wildcard '*' support.
   * Schema, port and query are ignored.
   * At most 100 URLs can be added into the allowlist,

  For <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>, this policy is only effective when the machine is enrolled with <ph name="CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN">CloudManagementEnrollmentToken</ph>.

  More information about legacy technologies can be found at https://chromestatus.com/features.
