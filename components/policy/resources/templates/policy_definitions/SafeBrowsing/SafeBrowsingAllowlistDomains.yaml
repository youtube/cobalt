caption: Configure the list of domains on which Safe Browsing will not trigger warnings.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means Safe Browsing will trust the domains you designate. It won't check them for dangerous resources such as phishing, malware, or unwanted software. Safe Browsing's download protection service won't check downloads hosted on these domains. Its password protection service won't check for password reuse.

        Leaving the policy unset means default Safe Browsing protection applies to all resources.

        This policy must be set as a list of fully qualified domain names. It does not support regular expressions, and will not allowlist subdomains of domains listed in the policy.
