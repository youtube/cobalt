This file is used by the WebView unittests for loading media asset files,
see android_webview_unittests_apk and AwMediaUrlInterceptorTest.

This is a text file, but we use the .ogg extension so that aapt will not
compress its contents. This is ok for the purpose of the unit tests since
they do not play the media, and they are only interested in the existence of
an uncompressed media file in the assets directory.
