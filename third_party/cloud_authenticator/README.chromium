Description:
This directory contains the partial source code for the passkeys enclave. The
full source (which is not yet available at the time of writing, but which it is
intended to be in the future) builds an "application" that runs under the [Oak
restricted kernel]
(https://github.com/project-oak/oak/tree/main/oak_restricted_kernel). In
Chromium we just want to be able to test the Chromium client against a
reasonable simulation of the enclave system and thus nothing but the core of
the processing is needed.

The production enclave build uses [ring](https://crates.io/crates/ring) to
provide cryptographic primitives in a `no_std` environment. In Chromium,
BoringSSL is used instead.
