  <owner>rkaplow@google.com</owner>
  <owner>chrome-metrics-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged when doing a partial purges of unsent UKM logs. If the unsent log has
    a different app version that the client's current version then a true is
    logged and the report's log_written_by_app_version should be set with the
    current version. Otherwise a false is logged.
  </summary>

<histogram name="UKM.BuildAndStoreLogIsEmpty" enum="Boolean"
    expires_after="2025-05-01">
  <owner>rkaplow@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-metrics-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Emitted when UKM Service attempts to build and store a log. Emits true if it
    was empty (no sources or entries) which means no log is written, false
    otherwise.
  </summary>

  <owner>andrewbregger@google.com</owner>
  <owner>chrome-metrics-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged in UpdateUkmAllowedForAllProfiles from the UkmConsentStateObserver.
    This records if App-sync was changed everytime a profile is updated. True
    will be recorded when App-sync changes and false otherwise. This is to
    understand how often App-sync is changed.

    data.

    it should be dropped.

    sent in the UKM log but truncated to 31 bits with &quot;event_hash &amp;

    it should be dropped due to reaching the max number of sources allowed in
    memory.

  <summary>
    Logged during UkmService initialization whether the init task or the initial
    log timer completed first. The expectation is the vast majority of the time,
    the init task should complete first. If metrics show otherwise, then it may
    indicate there's a bug in the UkmService init sequence and that it should be
    investigated.

  <summary>
    Number of times when UKM.LogSize.OnSuccess was recorded on iOS. Recorded
    when the app transitions to the foreground. This histogram should help to
    figure out the root cause of crbug.com/1154678 (Data loss on UMA in iOS). If
    total count of UKM.IOSLog.OnSuccess is greater than number of
    UKM.LogSize.OnSuccess records, then data loss is caused by failure to write
    the histogram to the disk on background thread. Otherwise (if total sum of
    UKM.IOSLog.OnSuccess is equal to total count of UKM.LogSize.OnSuccess
    records) then there is actually no data loss and app simply gets terminated
    in a short window between UKM reached the server and the API call which
    records the data.
