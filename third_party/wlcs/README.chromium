Description:
WLCS is a test suite which verifies protocol-level conformance for
wayland compositors. This code will be used in two ways:
1) A subset of header files (distributed under GPL3) will be #included
   in chromium code to allow the test harness to interface with our
   code.
2) Test binaries can be built by automated builders or local developers
   in order to gauge the conformance of chromium's wayland compositor
   against the suite.
This code is licensed under the GPL2 and GPL3, see src/COPYING.* for
details.
