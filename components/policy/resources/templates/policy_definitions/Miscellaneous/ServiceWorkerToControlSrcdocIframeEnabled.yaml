caption: Allow ServiceWorker to control srcdoc iframes
desc: |-
  https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/765 asks srcdoc iframe with
  the "allow-same-origin" sandbox attribute to be under ServiceWorker control.

  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> makes srcdoc iframes
  with "allow-same-origin" sandbox attributes to be under ServiceWorker control.

  Setting the policy to Disabled leaves the srcdoc iframe not controlled by
  ServiceWorker.

  This policy is intended to be temporary and will be removed in 2026.
