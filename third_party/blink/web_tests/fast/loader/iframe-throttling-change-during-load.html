  // will be throttled as soon as it loads. When the plugin element loads, it
  // will also become throttled, because its parent document is throttled. The
  // throttling state transition for the plugin can happen when the plugin
  // hasn't yet installed its content document. This test ensures that the
  // throttling state transition for the plugin doesn't cause a crash due to
  // the missing document.
