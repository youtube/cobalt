  If set to true, supervised users can be created and used.

            If set to false or not configured, supervised-user creation and login will be disabled. All existing supervised users will be hidden.

            NOTE: The default behavior for consumer and enterprise devices differs: on consumer devices supervised users are enabled by default, but on enterprise devices they are disabled by default.
