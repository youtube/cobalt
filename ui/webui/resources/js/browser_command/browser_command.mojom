// chrome.com content, and understood by the browser. They may trigger actions
// in the browser such as navigating to a chrome:// URL or initiating a helpful
// flow. The implementer of the CommandHandler interface chooses which commands
// to handle and which ones to ignore depending on the platform or the
// milestone. Note that the implementations of these commands must be
// side-effect-free.
// These values are persisted to logs. Entries should not be renumbered and
// numeric values should never be reused.
// Please update enums.xml upon addition of new commands.
