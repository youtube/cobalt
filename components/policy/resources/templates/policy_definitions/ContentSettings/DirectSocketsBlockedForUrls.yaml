caption: Block Direct Sockets API on these sites
desc: |-
  The Direct Sockets API allows communication with arbitrary endpoints using TCP and UDP.
  Please see https://github.com/WICG/direct-sockets for details.

  Setting the policy lets you list the URL patterns that specify which sites are not allowed to communicate using the Direct Sockets API.
  Valid patterns are limited to Isolated Web Apps.

  Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="DEFAULT_DIRECT_SOCKETS_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultDirectSocketsSetting</ph> applies for all sites, if it's set.

  URL patterns must not conflict with <ph name="DIRECT_SOCKETS_ALLOWED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">DirectSocketsAllowedForUrls</ph>. Neither policy takes precedence if a URL matches with both.

  For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph> is not an accepted value for this policy.
