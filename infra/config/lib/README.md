# Starlark libraries

This directory contains libraries that implement additional functionality on top
of that provided by lucicfg.

## lucicfg graph

Many of the libraries work with the lucicfg graph. See
[lucicfg-graph.md](lucicfg-graph.md) to learn about how lucicfg
processes the graph and about the code used for manipulating the graph.
