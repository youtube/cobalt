caption: List of names that will bypass the HSTS policy check
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies a list of hostnames that bypass preloaded HSTS upgrades from http to https.

        Only single-label hostnames are allowed in this policy, and this policy only applies to "static" HSTS-preloaded entries (for instance, <ph name="EXAMPLE_HSTS_PRELOAD_TLDS">"app", "new", "search", "play"</ph>). This policy does not prevent HSTS upgrades for servers that have "dynamically" requested HSTS upgrades using a <ph name="HSTS_HEADER_NAME">Strict-Transport-Security</ph> response header.

        Supplied hostnames must be canonicalized: Any IDNs must be converted to their A-label format, and all ASCII letters must be lowercase. This policy only applies to the specific single-label hostnames specified, not to subdomains of those names.
