======================================
C++ Tutorial: Getting Started (Part 2)
======================================

Please see the online documentation here:

  https://developers.google.com/native-client/devguide/tutorial


Part 2 of the tutorial is the same as part 1, except:

* The SDK build system is now used. This simplifies supporting multiple NaCl
  toolchains (e.g. pnacl, clang-newlib, glibc). See
  $NACL_SDK_ROOT/README.Makefiles for more information about the SDK Build
  system.

* The example loads common.js, a JavaScript file that has common code used in
  all of the SDK examples.

* index.html has been simplified, and all JavaScript code has been moved to
  separate .js files. This makes the example Content Security Policy
  (CSP)-compliant. See
  http://developer.chrome.com/apps/contentSecurityPolicy.html for more details.
  CSP-compliance is required for Chrome Packaged apps.
