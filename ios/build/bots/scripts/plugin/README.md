## How to Test Locally
1. Edit the comment section in test_plugin_client.py with your custom code that you want to test
2. In one terminal, start the server with
        `python test_plugin_server.py`
3. In another terminal, start the client with
        `python test_plugin_client.py`

## Unit Test
unit test should be automatically run during presubmit. You can also run it manually with
        `python test_plugin_service.py`
