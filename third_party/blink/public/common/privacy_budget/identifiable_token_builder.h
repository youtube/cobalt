//   * The digest returned by this class is *NOT* the same as the one

//     block based chaining of digests used by this class.
//     IdentifiabilityDigestOfBytes and this class are *NOT* interchangeable.
//
//     TODO(asanka): IdentifiabilityDigestOfBytes() and this class should
//     interop better. Perhaps by making the latter use the former.
//
//   * The digest returned by this class is *NOT* the same as what you would
//     acquire by invoking IdentifiableToken() over the same object.
//     IdentifiableToken() and this class are *NOT* interchangeable.
//
//   * The digest returned by this class only depends on the cumulative sequence
//     of bytes that are fed to it. The partitioning thereof is irrelevant.
//
//   * This object never finalizes. Partial digests can be extracted at any
//     point.
