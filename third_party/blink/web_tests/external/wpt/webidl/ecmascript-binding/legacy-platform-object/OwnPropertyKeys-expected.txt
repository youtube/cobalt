This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS must enumerate property indices in ascending numerical order
PASS must enumerate property names in list order
PASS must first enumerate property indices in ascending numerical order, then named properties in list order
FAIL must enumerate own properties after indexed and named properties even when they're added first assert_array_equals:  actual ["0","1","foo","bar","id","class"] expected ["0","1","id","class","foo","bar"] expected property 2 to be "id" but got "foo" (expected array ["0", "1", "id", "class", "foo", "bar"] got ["0", "1", "foo", "bar", "id", "class"])
FAIL must enumerate symbols after strings, regardless of which ones got added first assert_array_equals:  actual ["0","1","foo","bar","Symbol()","Symbol()","id","class"] expected ["0","1","id","class","foo","bar","Symbol()","Symbol()"] expected property 2 to be "id" but got "foo" (expected array ["0", "1", "id", "class", "foo", "bar", symbol "Symbol()", symbol "Symbol()"] got ["0", "1", "foo", "bar", symbol "Symbol()", symbol "Symbol()", "id", "class"])
Harness: the test ran to completion.
