// H5vcc stands for "HTML5 Video Container for Consoles".
// The H5vcc node acts as a Javascript namespace collecting various disparate
// APIs which allow ***REMOVED*** to call non-standard native functions that we expose.
// For example we provide a h5vcc.storage.ClearCookies(), which can empty the
// cookie jar in response to the user's request.
// Other H5vcc modules expose audio capabilities about the platform, or
// run an in-app DIAL server.
// The H5vcc node should just be a collection of readonly sub-nodes.
// This is created by the BrowserModule and passed directly to the Window
// during construction.
// TODO(***REMOVED***): Investigate injecting this directly into Window, rather
// than having Window have an explicit h5vcc attribute.

interface H5vcc {
  readonly attribute H5vccStorage storage;
