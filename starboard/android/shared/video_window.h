// Purpose: Decouples the JNI thread (which notifies about surface destruction)
// from the player worker thread (which performs the teardown). It schedules
// the teardown task on the player worker thread and waits for it with a timeout
// to avoid hanging the JNI thread.
//
// Lifetime/Ownership: This class is RefCountedThreadSafe. It is created by
// VideoSurfaceHolder when acquiring the surface, and references are held by
// the global `GetGlobalSurfaceDestroyNotifier()` and the
// `MediaCodecVideoDecoder`. The task scheduled on the JobQueue also retains a
// reference to ensure the object stays alive until execution completes.
//
// Threading Model: `Notify()` is called from the JNI thread.
// `NotifyDestroyed()` executes on the player worker thread. Internal state is
// protected by its own mutex.
