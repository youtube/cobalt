  <summary>
    Measures time that the users will most likely spend actively waiting for the
    Account Capabilities to load, when they were not available. Contrary to
    Signin.AccountCapabilities.UserVisibleLatency, this metric is more closely
    tracking the actual latency of the fetch of AccountCapabilities, by the
    means of impact on the user interface that had to present a loading spinner
    of similar view.

    Recorded when an extended account info is updated and the account info has
    Capabilities during displaying of the sync consent screen.

  <summary>
    Indicates whether the Account Capabilities were immediately available when
    requested. Together with Signin.AccountCapabilities.UserVisibleLatency, they
    are tracking the time and the type of fetch (synchronous or asynchronous)
    from the user's perspective.

    Recorded when the following conditions hold: a sync consent screen is
    displayed, the user is signed in and not syncing, and the primary account
    info has Capabilities.
  </summary>

  <owner>chrome-signin-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Measures time that the users will most likely spend actively waiting for the
    Account Capabilities to load. This metric is not tracking the actual latency
    of the fetch of AccountCapabilities, but only the time when those
    capabilities are required but not available yet.

    Example use case of this metric is to track time needed to wait for the
    Account Capabilities before presenting the Signin consent screen.

    See Signin.AccountCapabilities.ImmediatelyAvailable to analyse what portion
    of data in this metric was recorded as immediately available (0ms). See
    Signin.AccountCapabilities.FetchLatency to analyse time spent by users that
    for whom the UI was blocked until the Capabilities were ready.

    Recorded in two situations. 1. When an extended account info is updated and
    the account info has Capabilities while the sync consent screen is
    displayed. 2. When the following conditions hold: a sync consent screen is
    displayed, the user is signed in and not syncing, and the primary account
    info has Capabilities.
