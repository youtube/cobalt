The Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification (MPRIS) is a D-Bus interface
for controlling media players:
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/2.2/

This component is Chromium's implementation of the MPRIS interface. This allows
MPRIS clients to control media playback and view metadata about currently
playing media.

MPRIS is available for desktop Linux when D-Bus is available.
