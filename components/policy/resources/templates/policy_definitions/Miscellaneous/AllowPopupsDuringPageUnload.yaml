caption: Allows a page to show pop-ups during its unloading
default_for_enterprise_users: false
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to True allows pages to show pop-ups while the pages unload.

        Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset prevents pages from showing pop-ups while the pages unload.

        This policy was removed in Chrome 88 and is ignored if set.
