  <h1>App to Test minimum_chrome_version</h1>

  <h3>This app has three versions:</h3>
  <h3>Version 1.0.0 is a regular app and should always work.</h3>
  <h3>
    Version 2.0.0 sets the `minimum_chrome_version` field in the manifest to an old Chrome version, so it
    should be installable in current Chrome versions.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    Version 3.0.0 sets the `minimum_chrome_version` field in the manifest to a
    Chrome version M999, so it shouldn't be installable in Chrome versions for
    the foreseeable future.
  </h3>

  <h2 style="color:yellow">This is version 1.0.0</h2>
