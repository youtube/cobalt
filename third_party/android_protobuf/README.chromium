Description:
Android protobuf library contains the nano version of the Java protobuf library,
which generates Java-files with fewer methods than the protobuf lite compiler,
which is needed for big Java projects since Android has a maximum number of
methods per application.

The 'android_protoc' target file list is taken from COMPILER_SRC_FILES in
src/Android.mk.

See //third_party/protobuf for the C++ version of protobuf.

Local Modifications:
None.
