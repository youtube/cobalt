"""Library for handling details for bootstrapping builder properties.

Enabling bootstrapping for a builder provides versioning of the properties:
property changes for CQ builders will be applied during the CQ run and when
building a revision of code, the properties that are applied will be the
properties that were set for the builder at that revision.

This is accomplished by the use of a passthrough-style bootstrapper luciexe. The
properties specified in the starlark for the builder are written out to a
separate file. The builder's definition in cr-buildbucket.cfg is updated to use
the bootstrapper executable and the builder is updated to use the bootstrapper
and have properties set that the bootstrapper consumes. These properties enable
the bootstrapper to apply the properties from the properties file and then
execute the exe that was specified for the builder.

To enable bootstrapping for a builder, bootstrap must be set to True in its
builder definition its and it must be using a bootstrappable recipe. See
//recipes.star for more information on bootstrappable recipes.
