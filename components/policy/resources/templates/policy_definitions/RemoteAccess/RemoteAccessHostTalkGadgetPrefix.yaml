caption: Configure the TalkGadget prefix for remote access hosts
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Configures the TalkGadget prefix that will be used by remote access hosts and prevents users from changing it.

            If specified, this prefix is prepended to the base TalkGadget name to create a full domain name for the TalkGadget. The base TalkGadget domain name is '.talkgadget.google.com'.

            If this setting is enabled, then hosts will use the custom domain name when accessing the TalkGadget instead of the default domain name.

            If this setting is disabled or not set, then the default TalkGadget domain name ('chromoting-host.talkgadget.google.com') will be used for all hosts.

            Remote access clients are not affected by this policy setting. They will always use 'chromoting-client.talkgadget.google.com' to access the TalkGadget.
