caption: Floating SSO Service blocked domain list
desc: |-
  Configures a list of blocked cookie domains that will not be moved when a user switches between <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> devices, when the Floating SSO Service is enabled.

  If a cookie is set for a domain which matches one of the provided filters, the cookie is excluded from the move. Cookie domains are matched according to "host" field rules outlined in https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format, all other fields are ignored. Wildcards, <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph>, are allowed.

  The <ph name="FLOATING_SSO_DOMAIN_BLOCKLIST_EXCEPTIONS_POLICY_NAME">FloatingSsoDomainBlocklistExceptions</ph> policy takes precedence.
