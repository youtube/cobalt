caption: Safe Browsing Protection Level
desc: |-
  Allows you to control whether <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>'s Safe Browsing feature is enabled and the mode it operates in.

        If this policy is set to 'NoProtection' (value 0), Safe Browsing is never active.

        If this policy is set to 'StandardProtection' (value 1, which is the default), Safe Browsing is always active in the standard mode.

        If this policy is set to 'EnhancedProtection' (value 2), Safe Browsing is always active in the enhanced mode, which provides better security, but requires sharing more browsing information with Google.

        If you set this policy as mandatory, users cannot change or override the Safe Browsing setting in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        If this policy is left not set, Safe Browsing will operate in Standard Protection mode but users can change this setting.

        See https://support.google.com/chrome?p=safe_browsing_preferences for more info on Safe Browsing.
