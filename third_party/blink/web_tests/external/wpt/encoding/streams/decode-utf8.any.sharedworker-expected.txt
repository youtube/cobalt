This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] decoding one UTF-8 chunk should give one output string - ArrayBuffer
[PASS] decoding an empty chunk should give no output chunks - ArrayBuffer
[PASS] an initial empty chunk should be ignored - ArrayBuffer
[PASS] a trailing empty chunk should be ignored - ArrayBuffer
[PASS] UTF-8 EOF handling - ArrayBuffer
[FAIL] decoding one UTF-8 chunk should give one output string - SharedArrayBuffer
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: The provided ArrayBufferView value must not be shared."
[FAIL] decoding an empty chunk should give no output chunks - SharedArrayBuffer
