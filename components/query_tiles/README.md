# Query Tiles Service

## Introduction
Query tiles is a new feature to bring down the barriers for NIU users and boost
their confidence when using Chrome in Android.  It encourages users to explore
the internet by simply clicking on a few image tiles, and building a search
query to find the information they want.

With this feature enabled, users will see a list of image tiles with the
corresponding query strings shown on NTP(new tab page) and Omnibox suggestions.
By clicking on those tiles, users will be directed to the search result page
provided.

The client side will schedule fetch tasks from Google server periodically to
update the latest data and images based on the user's locale.
