This test ensures that if an autoscroll starts from within a scrollable div in an iframe, it does not propagate to its non-scrollable document body. Furthermore, it tests that if the body has only one of overflowX or overflowY set to hidden, the scrollable axis actually scrolls. Note that this test is pertaining to crbug.com/531525.
