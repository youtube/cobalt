-- The scripts below analyse traces with the following tracing options

--  NOTE: A regular speedometer run (e.g. from the website) will generate the

--
-- Noteworthy tables:
--   speedometer_mark: List of marks (event slices) emitted by Speedometer.
--       These are the points in time Speedometer makes a clock reading to
--       compute intervals of time for the final score.
--   speedometer_measure_slice: Augmented slices for Speedometer measurements.
--       These are the intervals of time Speedometer uses to compute the final
--       score.
--   speedometer_iteration_slice: Slice that covers one Speedometer iteration
--       and has the total_time and score for it. If you average all the scores
--       over all iterations you get the final Speedometer score for the run.
