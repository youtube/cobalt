# Experimental Fuzzers and Utilities

This directory contains experimental features pertaining to fuzzers and their
associated tooling as applied to Chromium. Please don't take dependencies on any
code here or assume that it will remain in its current form.

You are welcome and encouraged to propose changes that would make fuzzing
Chromium easier.

We'd like this to be an incubator for new Chromium fuzzing techniques and tools.
The contents are meant to be more malleable and transient than other parts of
Chromium tree. Code may be removed, promoted to elsewhere in the tree, or parked
to invite future contributions.
