caption: The virtual keyboard resizes the layout viewport by default
default: false
desc: "Setting the policy to True causes the virtual keyboard to resize the layout\
  \ viewport by default.\n      Other states (False/unset) have no effect.\n\n   \
  \   Note that this only affects the default resizing behavior: if a page requests\
  \ a specific behavior using a &lt;meta&gt; tag or the Virtual Keyboard API, then\
  \ that requested behavior will still apply.\n\n      Note also that this is an \"\
  escape hatch\" policy that's intended to be short-lived.\n      "
