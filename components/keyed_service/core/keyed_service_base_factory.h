// Base class for factories that take an opaque pointer and return some service.

// This object describes general dependency management between factories while
// direct subclasses react to lifecycle events and implement memory management.
//
// All factories must have been created at least once before the context is
// created in order to work correctly (see crbug.com/1150733). The standard way
// to do this in a //content-based embedder is to call FooFactory::GetInstance()
// for each factory used by your embedder from your embedder's implementation of
// content::BrowserMainParts::PreMainMessageLoopRun(). See //weblayer's
// browser_main_parts_impl.cc for a straightforward example.
