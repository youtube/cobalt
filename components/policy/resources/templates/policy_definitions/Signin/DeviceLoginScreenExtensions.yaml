caption: Configure the list of installed apps and extensions on the login screen
desc: |2-

        Specifies a list of apps and extensions that are installed silently on the login screen, without user interaction, and which cannot be uninstalled or disabled by the user.

        Permissions requested by the apps/extensions are granted implicitly, without user interaction, including any additional permissions requested by future versions of the app/extension. <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> restricts the set of permissions that the extensions can request.

        Note that, for security and privacy reasons, only apps and extensions that belong to the allow list bundled into <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> can be installed. All other items will be ignored.

        If an app or extension that previously had been force-installed is removed from this list, it is automatically uninstalled by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an "update" URL separated by a semicolon (<ph name="SEMICOLON">;</ph>). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on <ph name="CHROME_EXTENSIONS_LINK">chrome://extensions</ph> when in developer mode. The "update" URL, if specified, should point to an update manifest XML document as described at <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC1">https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate</ph>. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used (which currently is "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx"). Note that the "update" URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest.

        For example, <ph name="LOGIN_SCREEN_EXTENSION_POLICY_EXAMPLE">khpfeaanjngmcnplbdlpegiifgpfgdco;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx</ph> installs the <ph name="SMART_CARD_CONNECTOR_APP_NAME">Smart Card Connector</ph> app from the standard Chrome Web Store "update" URL.
