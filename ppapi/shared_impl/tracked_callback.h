// |TrackedCallback| represents a tracked Pepper callback (from the browser to
// the plugin), typically still pending. Such callbacks have the standard Pepper
// callback semantics. Execution (i.e., completion) of callbacks happens through
// objects of subclasses of |TrackedCallback|. Two things are ensured: (1) that
// the callback is executed at most once, and (2) once a callback is marked to
// be aborted, any subsequent completion is abortive (even if a non-abortive
// completion had previously been scheduled).
//
// The details of non-abortive completion depend on the type of callback (e.g.,
// different parameters may be required), but basic abort functionality is core.
// The ability to post aborts is needed in many situations to ensure that the
// plugin is not re-entered into. (Note that posting a task to just run
// |Abort()| is different and not correct; calling |PostAbort()| additionally
// guarantees that all subsequent completions will be abortive.)
//
// This class is reference counted so that different things can hang on to it,
// and not worry too much about ensuring Pepper callback semantics. Note that
// the "owning" |CallbackTracker| will keep a reference until the callback is
// completed.
//
// A note on threading:
// TrackedCallback is usable on any thread. It is *mostly* only used when
// ppapi::ProxyLock is held. However, it's necessary that Run() can be called
// without the ProxyLock. This is used to allow running the callback from
// the IO thread. In particular, blocking callbacks may not have a message loop
// to which we could post, so Run() must be able to signal the condition
// variable to wake up the thread that's waiting on the blocking callback, and
// Run() must be able to do this while not holding the ProxyLock.
