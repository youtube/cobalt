## Model

Although Cobalt is built to process web content similar to browsers,
it is not a web browser. Our security model assumes _only trusted content
processing_.

Please use [https://developers.google.com/youtube/cobalt](https://developers.google.com/youtube/cobalt/docs/communication) as an overall guide where to report issues.
