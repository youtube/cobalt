Description:
OpenXR is a royalty-free, open standard that provides high-performance access to
Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)—collectively known as
XR—platforms and devices.

Local Modifications:
No modifications to upstream files. BUILD.gn contains all of the configurations
needed to build the OpenXR loader in Chromium, along with its dependencies. The
readme was expanded with information about transitive dependencies that are
copied directly into the OpenXR SDK repository. An openxr.def file works around
the fact that attributes aren't exposed by default for the compiler we use on
windows in component builds.

Added dev/xr_android.h for prototyping xr_android extensions that are currently
under active development and not in any openxr release at present. This file is
expected to be superceded by any official definitions and may require additional
work before a roll containing those definitions can be conducted.

Copied src/.clang-format into src_overrides/.clang-format and disabled
clang-format in src_overrides/src/external to mimic how khronos gitlab seems to
behave. This allows forked files to more closely match the base-files and allow
for easier "Compare with clipboard" comparisons.

The following changes should be reflected in `src_overrides/patches`:
* Forked android_utilites.cpp and manifest_file.cpp to allow for customizing to
ignore loading in Android ContentProvider supplied paths while investigating and
waiting for upstreaming.

Description:
JNIPP is just a C++ wrapper for the standard Java Native Interface (JNI).It
tries to take some of the long-winded annoyance out of integrating your Java
and C++ code.

Local Modifications:
No modifications to upstream files. BUILD.gn contains all of the configurations
needed to build the library in Chromium.

Description:
Python tool to generate C++ wrappers for (mostly Android-related) JNI/Java
objects. Generated files are typically slightly hand-modified.

Local Modifications:
No modifications to upstream files. BUILD.gn contains all of the configurations
needed to build the library in Chromium, along with its dependencies. Since it
is a transitive dependency that was directly included in OpenXR SDK repository,
the exact revision is unknown. The library also does not have any versioned
releases. The library contains auto-generated files with unknown hand-made
modifications. The library is triple-licensed, and the copy from OpenXR SDK
repository does not include a LICENSE file.
