    <!-- 2x LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE followed by =ignore,width=123
         During parsing the content will be converted to lower case with proper
         unicode folding (F = full) meaning that the U+0130's each will be
         converted into two chars - lowercase i followed by U+0307 (COMBINING
         DOT ABOVE). This test case checks that we iterate over the lowered
         string length and ends up with 123 as width, instead of 1. -->
