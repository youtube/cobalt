caption: Set default state of the on-screen keyboard on the login screen
default: null
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy is deprecated, please use the <ph name="DEVICE_LOGIN_SCREEN_VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeviceLoginScreenVirtualKeyboardEnabled</ph> policy instead.

        Setting the policy to True turns the on-screen keyboard on at sign-in. Setting the policy to False turns the on-screen keyboard off at sign-in.

        If you set the policy, users can temporarily turn the on-screen keyboard on or off. When the sign-in screen reloads or stays idle for a minute, it reverts to its original state.

        If not set, the on-screen keyboard is off at the sign-in screen. Users can turn it on any time, and its status on the sign-in screen persists across users.

        Note: <ph name="DEVICE_LOGIN_SCREEN_VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeviceLoginScreenVirtualKeyboardEnabled</ph> overrides this policy if the former is specified.
