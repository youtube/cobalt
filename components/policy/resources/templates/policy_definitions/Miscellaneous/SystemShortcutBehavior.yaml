desc: |-
  This policy controls shortcut behavior on <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>.

  If this policy is unset or set to <ph name="NORMAL_SYSTEM_PRIORITY">NormalSystemPriority</ph>, all <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> system shortcuts will always activate as expected.

  If this policy is set to <ph name="SHOULD_IGNORE_COMMON_VDI_SHORTCUTS">ShouldIgnoreCommonVdiShortcuts</ph>, a predetermined list of Launcher key shortcuts will never activate a shortcut.

  If this policy is set to <ph name="SHOULD_IGNORE_COMMON_VDI_SHORTCUTS_FULLSCREEN_ONLY">ShouldIgnoreCommonVdiShortcutsFullscreenOnly</ph>, a predetermined list of Launcher key shortcuts will never activate a shortcut while an app is fullscreen.

  If this policy is set to <ph name="ALLOW_PASSTHROUGH_OF_SEARCH_BASED_SHORTCUTS">AllowPassthroughOfSearchBasedShortcuts</ph>, shortcuts with the Search key flow through to apps and are not consumed by the OS.

  If this policy is set to <ph name="ALLOW_PASSTHROUGH_OF_SEARCH_BASED_SHORTCUTS_FULLSCREEN_ONLY">AllowPassthroughOfSearchBasedShortcutsFullscreenOnly</ph>, shortcuts with the Search key flow through to apps and are not consumed by the OS, but only when the focused app is fullscreen.
