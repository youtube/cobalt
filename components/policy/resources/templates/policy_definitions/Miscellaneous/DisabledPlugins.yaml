caption: Specify a list of disabled plugins
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy is deprecated. Please use the <ph name="DEFAULT_PLUGINS_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultPluginsSetting</ph> to control the availability of the Flash plugin and <ph name="ALWAYS_OPEN_PDF_EXTERNALLY_POLICY_NAME">AlwaysOpenPdfExternally</ph> to control whether the integrated PDF viewer should be used for opening PDF files.

        Specifies a list of plugins that are disabled in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> and prevents users from changing this setting.

        The wildcard characters '*' and '?' can be used to match sequences of arbitrary characters. '*' matches an arbitrary number of characters while '?' specifies an optional single character, i.e. matches zero or one characters. The escape character is '\', so to match actual '*', '?', or '\' characters, you can put a '\' in front of them.

        If you enable this setting, the specified list of plugins is never used in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>. The plugins are marked as disabled in 'about:plugins' and users cannot enable them.

        Note that this policy can be overridden by EnabledPlugins and DisabledPluginsExceptions.

        If this policy is left not set the user can use any plugin installed on the system except for hard-coded incompatible, outdated or dangerous plugins.
