  <variant name="ChangeTab2"
      summary="Changing tabs. Note that this histogram uses presentation
               callbacks to determine the end of the tab change (which is
               when the tab change is presented on the screen). However,
               before M110 it was possible that the callback was called even
               if the next submitted frame failed to present successfully.
               Since M110, the histogram switched to using presentation
               callbacks that are only called when the first following frame
               is successfully presented on the screen (hence version 2)"/>

    This metric is only recorded on iOS. This measures the sum of
    PrivateMemoryFootprint and SharedMemoryFootprint, which is possible because
    Chromium on iOS is single-process. Note that this does not include memory
    consumed by WebKit-launched processes, such as the WebContent and Network
    processes.

    Emitted when closing a log in order to upload it. This happens shortly after
    startup and again at regular intervals (usually 5 minutes, regardless of the
    type of network connection). Not emitted in logs that are closed when Chrome
    loses focus or closes. Yet, it is emitted on logs that are constructed from
    data persisted from a previous session, i.e., persisted from an unclean
    shutdown.

    Many changes in memory usage on iOS come from changes to WebKit, rather than
    changes within Chromium code. To assess whether a change in this metric is
    caused by a WebKit change, split by OS version. WebKit changes always come
    with an OS version change.

    As with other memory metrics, memory use tends to increase over time.
    Restarts due to OS or Chrome updates tend to make this metric drop.

    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

    WARNING: This metric does not include the footprint of the graphics buffers
    on all platforms. Concretely, this means that on these platforms, this
    metric will drastically underestimate the true cost of rendering. On devices
    with unified memory (most Android, laptop and desktop clients with
    integrated graphics, and all ARM64 mac clients), graphics buffers come from
    the same memory pool as system RAM. For more details, alternative metrics to

  <summary>
    An estimate of additional processes created due to origin-keyed processes,
    including OriginAgentCluster (OAC) headers and OriginKeyedProcessesByDefault
    mode. Computed assuming no coalescing of multiple BrowsingInstances into a
    single RenderProcess (including no subframe process reuse), and only when
    cross-process origin isolation occurs due to the OAC header or
    OriginKeyedProcessesByDefault. Given this, the count of additional
    SiteInstances corresponds exactly to the additional number of
    RenderProcesses that that are due to origin-keying, and therefore gives a
    sense of how much process count overhead it creates. Recorded once per UMA
    ping.

    Note: when the feature OriginKeyedProcessesByDefault is enabled, all
    navigations are treated as if the OAC opt-in header is present, unless the
    OAC opt-out header is present. As a result, any analyses of this metric
    should separate users with and without OriginKeyedProcessesByDefault, to
    distinguish actual header adoption.

    The average duration of each page of the guest memory lives in the swap
    file. We expect most cold pages live in the swap file for a long time and
    hot pages are not swapped out but kept in the memory. The durations are
    measured every 10 minutes to estimate the average duration. This is sent
    when vmm-swap is disabled.

    A rough estimate of the private memory footprint of the {UtilityProcessType}
    process.

    Recorded at Poisson sampled time intervals with a mean of 5 minutes on
    Android and 30 minutes on other platforms.

    This memory footprint metric cannot be compared across platforms because
    each platform relies on platform-level APIs for accounting. As such, though
    this attempts to measure private memory footprint as best as possible, it
    does not measure the same thing on each platform. We have not found a good
    way to compare any system level memory metric across platforms due to the
    different nature of memory management on each platform.

    The size of the resident memory in a {UtilityProcessType} process. This is
    influenced by factors we control (e.g. memory that is not accessed can be
    swapped) and factors we don't control (e.g. an unrelated process using a lot
    of memory can force memory in our process to be swapped). Recorded on
    Windows/Linux/ChromeOS/Android.

    Recorded at Poisson sampled time intervals with a mean of 5 minutes on
