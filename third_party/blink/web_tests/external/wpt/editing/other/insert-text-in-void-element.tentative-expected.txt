[FAIL] Inserting text when selection is collapsed in <embed> which is only child
  assert_in_array: The text should be inserted before the <embed> element value "<div><embed></div>" not in array ["<div>abc<embed></div>", "<div>abc<embed><br></div>"]
[FAIL] Inserting text when selection is collapsed in <embed> which is only child (explicitly flushes maybe pending layout)
  assert_in_array: The text should be inserted before the <embed> element value "<div><embed></div>" not in array ["<div>abc<embed></div>", "<div>abc<embed><br></div>"]
[FAIL] Inserting text when selection is collapsed in <embed> which is followed by a text node
  assert_in_array: The text should be inserted before the <embed> element value "<div><embed>abcdef</div>" not in array ["<div>abc<embed>def</div>", "<div>abc<embed>def<br></div>"]
[FAIL] Inserting text when selection is collapsed in <embed> which follows an empty <span> element
  assert_in_array: The text should be inserted before the previous empty inline element of <embed> value "<div><span></span><embed></div>" not in array ["<div>abc<span></span><embed></div>", "<div>abc<span></span><embed><br></div>"]
[FAIL] Inserting text when selection is collapsed in <embed> which follows a text node, an empty <span> element and white-space only text node

[FAIL] Inserting text when selection is collapsed in <hr> which follows a text node, an empty <span> element and white-space only text node
