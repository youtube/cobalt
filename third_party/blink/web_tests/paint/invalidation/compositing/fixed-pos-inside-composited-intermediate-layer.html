       Among other duplicate bugs: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=128375
       A non-composited fixed-position element can get grouped into a composited container.
       In this case, repaint invalidations were incorrectly going to the LayoutView instead
       of the composited container.  The incorrect result was that the fixed-position element
       never repainted, and it appeared to scroll along with the composited container.
