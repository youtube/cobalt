    should be activated for fingerprinting protection, records whether the
    filtering rules are available.

  <summary>
    Records the total time a child frame navigation was delayed due to alias
    checking, whether the check was triggered, and calculating whether it should
    be disallowed. Logged for all navigations that were marked {Result}.

    A {Result} marked as Checked indicates that the alias check was triggered,
    while Disallowed and WouldDisallow are LoadPolicy decisions determined by
    alias checking. Because alias checks are counted with
    FingerprintingProtection.DocumentLoad.SubframeFilteringDelay, alias allowed
    decisions can be derived.

    This metric uses UMA_HISTOGRAM_CUSTOM_MICROSECONDS_TIMES to acccount for
    clients with low-resolution clocks.

    The result of the IndexRulesetMatcher Verify method. Either pass if both the
    checksum and verifier succeeded, or a value indicating which combination of
    them failed. Note that a zero checksum indicates that the checksum has not
    yet been stored during indexing (for rulesets indexed prior to the
