# Tests for Attribution Reporting APIs with attribution scopes enabled

This virtual test suite covers a subset of Attribution Reporting APIs tests with
the `AttributionScopes` flag enabled.

This flag enables a new flow where attribution registrations can include fields
pertaining to attribution scopes, allowing for more finely-grained
pre-attribution source filtering.

The suite only covers tests related to DevTools reporting.
