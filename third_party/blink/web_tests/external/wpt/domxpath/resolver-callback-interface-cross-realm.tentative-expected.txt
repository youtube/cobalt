This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL XPathNSResolver is cross-realm plain object without 'lookupNamespaceURI' property assert_equals: expected "object" but got "undefined"
FAIL XPathNSResolver is cross-realm plain object with non-callable 'lookupNamespaceURI' property assert_equals: expected "object" but got "undefined"
FAIL XPathNSResolver is cross-realm non-callable revoked Proxy assert_equals: expected "object" but got "undefined"
FAIL XPathNSResolver is cross-realm callable revoked Proxy assert_equals: expected function "function TypeError() { [native code] }" but got function "function TypeError() { [native code] }"
FAIL XPathNSResolver is cross-realm plain object with revoked Proxy as 'lookupNamespaceURI' property assert_equals: expected function "function TypeError() { [native code] }" but got function "function TypeError() { [native code] }"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
