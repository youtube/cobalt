# Google Chrome branded builds

By default, chromium will build with the open source chromium assets and
branding (`is_chrome_branded = false` in
[GN args](https://www.chromium.org/developers/gn-build-configuration), see also
[Chrome vs. Chromium](chromium_browser_vs_google_chrome.md)).

The main reason for this is that the Google Chrome logo and related assets is
a trademark which we don't want to release under Chromium's open source
license.

Therefore, if you want to add a trademarked resource, check it into an internal
repository (see section below), and pick a resource based on the branding.  To
query in code whether the current build is branded, use:

- GN: `is_chrome_branded`
- C++: `#if BUILDFLAG(GOOGLE_CHROME_BRANDING)`
- Java: `BuildConfig.IS_CHROME_BRANDED`
- Grit: `<if expr="_google_chrome">`

If possible, check an open source version into Chromium, so the feature
continues to work as expected in the open source build.

E.g.
[`//components/resources/default_100_percent/chromium`](../components/resources/default_100_percent/chromium)
vs
[`//components/resources/default_100_percent/google_chrome`](https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chrome/components/default_100_percent/google_chrome/).

For strings, it’s ok to check them into the open source repository, but make
sure that you refer to the correct product, i.e., check in a version of the
string that says “Google Chrome” and a version that says “Chromium”.

E.g. [`//chrome/app/chromium_strings.grd`](../chrome/app/chromium_strings.grd)
vs
[`//chrome/app/google_chrome_strings.grd`](../chrome/app/google_chrome_strings.grd).

## Internal asset repositories

Assets live in various locations based on where they are used: native vs WebUI,
chrome vs component layer, etc. You can read more about this here:
[chromium.org | High DPI Resources](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/high-dpi-resources/)

To check in product-specific assets, in general:
- Add `//chrome` ones under
  `//chrome/app/theme[/optional_scale_factor_indicator]/[product_name]`. E.g.
  [`//chrome/app/theme/default_100_percent/chromium/product_logo_32.png`](../chrome/app/theme/default_100_percent/chromium/product_logo_32.png)

  > Note: WebUI-specific resources should go under
  > `//chrome/browser/resources/[/optional_scale_factor_indicator]/[product_name]`.
  > We don't have an internal repo associated yet, so please
  > [create one](http://go/git-admin-cheatsheet#creating-a-repo) if the use case
  > comes up.

- Add `//components` ones under
  `//components/resources[/optional_scale_factor_indicator]/[product_name]`.
  E.g.
  [`//components/resources/default_200_percent/chromium/product_logo.png`](../components/resources/default_200_percent/chromium/product_logo.png)

Each `google_chrome` version of a product directory points to a separate
internal git repo. Some examples:
- https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chrome/theme/google_chrome/
- https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chrome/theme/default_100_percent/google_chrome/
- https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chrome/components/default_200_percent/google_chrome/

To add resources there, `cd` to this repo, add your new assets and `git cl
upload` to start an internal code review. Once it lands, you will need to create
a roll CL for the `//../src-internal/DEPS`, using
[roll-dep](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/main/README.md#:~:text=cl.md.-,roll%2Ddep,-%3A%20A%20gclient%20dependency).

Once that CL lands, an auto-roller bot will update the main repo's src-internal
hash reference in `//DEPS` ([example autoroll CL](https://crrev.com/c/4024955))
and your new internal resources will be available on the bots. The chromium-side
CL making use of it can then be uploaded.

## Internal Clank assets

Internal Clank assets live in [Clank's internal downstream repo](https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/clank/internal/apps).
In general, to check in product-specific assets:
- Add `//components` ones under
  `//components/[product_name]/java/res/drawable/[asset_name]`.
  E.g.
  [`//components/page_info/java/res/drawable/product_logo.png`](https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/clank/internal/apps/+/refs/heads/main/components/page_info/java/res/drawable)

To add assets there, `cd` to this repo, add your new assets and `git cl
upload` to start an internal code review. Once it lands, an auto-roller bot will
update the main repo's src/clank hash reference in `//DEPS`
([example autoroll CL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4282317))
and your new internal assets will be available on the bots. The chromium-side
CL making use of it can then be uploaded.

The internal asset is only available on a Chrome branded build. We can not
utilize icons from the internal repo directly from Java because the assets
wouldn't be available in public builds. We can work around this by passing the
resource id to the native side and then back to Java (example [CL1](https://crrev.com/c/3327235),
[CL2](https://crrev.com/c/4286715)).
