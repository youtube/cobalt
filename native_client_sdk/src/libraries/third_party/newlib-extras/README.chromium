This directory contains several socket-related header files taken from newlib.
These files are not present in the version of newlib included in the NaCl
toolchain. Using these files allows nacl_io to provide POSIX socket
virtualization in the newlib and pnacl toolchains.

Description: (from sourceware.org/newlib)

Newlib is a C library intended for use on embedded systems. It is a
conglomeration of several library parts, all under free software licenses
that make them easily usable on embedded products.

Local Modifications:
* Removed the revoked third clause from the licenses in the header files.
* Correctly wrapped netdb.h to allow it to be included in both C and C++ files.
* Removed faulty _BSD_SIZE_T_ typedef in arpa/inet.h.
* Removed macros in arpa/inet.h which added underbars to various functions of
  the form inet_*, to avoid problems with forward declarations in user code.
* Added prototypes for htonl, htons, ntohl, and ntohs to netinet/in.h.
* Modified netinet/in.h not to use u_int32_t.
* Added SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK socket type flags.
* Make sure SA_SIGINFO is defined under __native_client__
* Removed ss_len field from sockaddr_storage in sys/socket.h.
* Added _ALIGNBYTES and _ALIGN() in sys/socket.h.
