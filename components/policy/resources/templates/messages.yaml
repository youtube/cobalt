  desc: Introduction text for the generated policy atomic group documentation
  text: Both Chromium and Google Chrome have some groups of policies that depend on
    each other to provide control over a feature. These sets are represented by the
    following policy groups. Given that policies can have multiple sources, only values
    coming from the highest priority source will be applied. Values coming from a
    lower priority source in the same group will be ignored. The order of priority
    is defined in <ph name="POLICY_PRIORITY_DOC_URL">https://support.google.com/chrome/a/?p=policy_order<ex>https://support.google.com/chrome/a/?p=policy_order</ex></ph>.
doc_intro:
  desc: Introduction text for the generated policy documentation
  text: |-
    Both Chromium and Google Chrome support the same set of policies. Please note that this document may include unreleased policies (i.e. their 'Supported on' entry refers to a not-yet released version of <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>) which are subject to change or removal without notice and for which no guarantees of any kind are provided, including no guarantees with respect to their security and privacy properties.

    These policies are strictly intended to be used to configure instances of <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> internal to your organization. Use of these policies outside of your organization (for example, in a publicly distributed program) is considered malware and will likely be labeled as malware by Google and anti-virus vendors.

    These settings don't need to be configured manually! Easy-to-use templates for Windows, Mac and Linux are available for download from <ph name="POLICY_TEMPLATE_DOWNLOAD_URL">https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-templates<ex> https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-templates</ex></ph>.

    The recommended way to configure policy on Windows is via GPO, although provisioning policy via registry is still supported for Windows instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> domain.
