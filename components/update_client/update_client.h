// The UpdateClient class is a facade with a simple interface. The interface
// exposes a few APIs to install a CRX or update a group of CRXs.
//
// The difference between a CRX install and a CRX update is relatively minor.
// The terminology going forward will use the word "update" to cover both
// install and update scenarios, except where details regarding the install
// case are relevant.
//
// Handling an update consists of a series of actions such as sending an update
// check to the server, followed by parsing the server response, identifying
// the CRXs that require an update, downloading the differential update if
// it is available, unpacking and patching the differential update, then
// falling back to trying a similar set of actions using the full update.
// At the end of this process, completion pings are sent to the server,
// as needed, for the CRXs which had updates.
//
// As a general idea, this code handles the action steps needed to update
// a group of components serially, one step at a time. However, concurrent
// execution of calls to UpdateClient::Update is possible, therefore,
// queuing of updates could happen in some cases. More below.
//
// The UpdateClient class features a subject-observer interface to observe
// the CRX state changes during an update.
//
// Most of the code in the public interface runs on a SequencedTaskRunner. This
// task runner corresponds to the browser UI thread but it can be any other
// sequenced task runner. There are parts of the installer interface that run
// on blocking task runners, which are usually sequences managed by the thread
// pool.
//
// Using the UpdateClient requires creating an instance, adding observers, and
// providing an installer instance, as shown below:
//
//    std::unique_ptr<UpdateClient> update_client(UpdateClientFactory(...));
//    update_client->AddObserver(&observer);
//    std::vector<std::string> ids;
//    ids.push_back(...));
//    update_client->Update(ids, base::BindOnce(...), base::BindOnce(...));
//
// UpdateClient::Update takes two callbacks as parameters. First callback
// allows the client of this code to provide an instance of CrxComponent
// data structure that specifies additional parameters of the update.
// CrxComponent has a CrxInstaller data member, which must be provided by the
// callers of this class. The second callback indicates that this non-blocking
// call has completed.
//
// There could be several ways of triggering updates for a CRX, user-initiated,
// or timer-based. Since the execution of updates is concurrent, the parameters
// for the update must be provided right before the update is handled.
// Otherwise, the version of the CRX set in the CrxComponent may not be correct.
//
// The UpdateClient public interface includes two functions: Install and
// Update. These functions correspond to installing one CRX immediately as a
// foreground activity (Install), and updating a group of CRXs silently in the
// background (Update). This distinction is important. Background updates are
// queued up and their actions run serially, one at a time, for the purpose of
// conserving local resources such as CPU, network, and I/O.
// On the other hand, installs are never queued up but run concurrently, as
// requested by the user.
//
// The update client introduces a runtime constraint regarding interleaving
// updates and installs. If installs or updates for a given CRX are in progress,
// then installs for the same CRX will fail with a specific error.
//
// Implementation details.
//
// The implementation details below are not relevant to callers of this
// code. However, these design notes are relevant to the owners and maintainers
// of this module.
//
// The design for the update client consists of a number of abstractions
// such as: task, update engine, update context, and action.
// The execution model for these abstractions is simple. They usually expose
// a public, non-blocking Run function, and they invoke a callback when
// the Run function has completed.
//
// A task is the unit of work for the UpdateClient. A task is associated
// with a single call of the Update function. A task represents a group
// of CRXs that are updated together.
//
// The UpdateClient is responsible for the queuing of tasks, if queuing is
// needed.
//
// When the task runs, it calls the update engine to handle the updates for
// the CRXs associated with the task. The UpdateEngine is the abstraction
// responsible for breaking down the update in a set of discrete steps, which
// are implemented as actions, and running the actions.
//
// The UpdateEngine maintains a set of UpdateContext instances. Each of
// these instances maintains the update state for all the CRXs belonging to
// a given task. The UpdateContext contains a queue of CRX ids.
// The UpdateEngine will handle updates for the CRXs in the order they appear
// in the queue, until the queue is empty.
//
// The update state for each CRX is maintained in a container of CrxUpdateItem*.
// As actions run, each action updates the CRX state, represented by one of
// these CrxUpdateItem* instances.
//
// Although the UpdateEngine can and will run update tasks concurrently, the
// actions of a task are run sequentially.
//
// The Action is a polymorphic type. There is some code reuse for convenience,
// implemented as a mixin. The polymorphic behavior of some of the actions
// is achieved using a template method.
//
// State changes of a CRX could generate events, which are observed using a
// subject-observer interface.
//
// The actions chain up. In some sense, the actions implement a state machine,
// as the CRX undergoes a series of state transitions in the process of
// being checked for updates and applying the update.
