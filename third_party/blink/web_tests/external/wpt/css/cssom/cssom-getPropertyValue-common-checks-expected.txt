This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] All properties can serialize 'initial'
[FAIL] All properties (except 'all') can serialize their initial value (computed)
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid", "none / none / none / row / auto / auto"], ["page-orientation", ""], ["popover-hide-delay", "infinity * 1s"], ["size", ""]] length 4
[FAIL] All properties (except 'all') can serialize their initial value (specified)
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid-column-gap", "normal", ""], ["grid-gap", "normal normal", ""], ["grid-row-gap", "normal", ""]] length 3
[PASS] All shorthands can serialize their longhands set to 'initial'
[FAIL] All shorthands (except 'all') can serialize their longhands set to their initial value
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["border", ""], ["grid-gap", ""]] length 2
[PASS] All aliases can serialize target property set to 'initial'
[FAIL] All aliases can serialize target property set to its initial value
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid-column-gap", ""], ["grid-row-gap", ""]] length 2
[PASS] Can't serialize shorthand when longhands are set to different css-wide keywords
[PASS] Can't serialize shorthand when longhands have different priority
[PASS] Can't serialize shorthand set to 'initial' when some longhand is missing
[PASS] Can't serialize shorthand set to initial value when some longhand is missing
Harness: the test ran to completion.
