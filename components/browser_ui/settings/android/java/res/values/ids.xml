    <!-- TODO(crbug.com/1407188): Remove this ID definition once it's no longer needs to be known
         by modules in targets that WebLayer depends on. Some alternatives: (1) Move
         `ManagedPreferencesUtils` to its own target, so that it's not imported by WebLayer;
         (2) Move the logic that depends on this ID to `ManagedPreferenceDelegate`.
