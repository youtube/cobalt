    // TODO: Revisit the UniformCache::insert and UniformData::Make APIs:
    // 1. UniformData::Make requires knowing the data size up front, which involves two invocations
    //    of the UniformManager. Ideally, we could align uniforms on the fly into a dynamic buffer.
    // 2. UniformData stores the offsets for each uniform, but these aren't needed after we've
    //    filled out the buffer. If we remember layout offsets, it should be stored per Combination
    //    or RenderStep that defines the uniform set.
    // 3. UniformCache's ids are only fundamentally limited by the number of draws that can be
    //    recorded into a DrawPass, which means a very large recording with multiple passes could
    //    exceed uint32_t across all the passes.
    // 4. The check to know if a UniformData is present in the cache is practically the same for
    //    checking if the data needs to be uploaded to the GPU, so UniformCache could remember the
    //    associated BufferBindInfos as well.
    // 5. Because UniformCache only cares about the content byte hash/equality, and can memcpy to
    //    the GPU buffer, the cached data contents could all go into a shared byte array, instead of
    //    needing to extend SkRefCnt.
    // 6. insert() as a name can imply that the value is always added, so we may want a better one.
    //    It can be a little less generic if UniformCache returns id and bind buffer info. On the
    //    other hand unordered_map::insert has the same semantics as this insert, so maybe it's fine

    // Add the block of uniform data to the cache and return a unique ID that corresponds to its
    // contents. If an identical block of data is already in the cache, that unique ID is returned.
