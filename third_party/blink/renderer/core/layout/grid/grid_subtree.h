// A grid tree is represented by a vector satisfying the following conditions:
//   - The nodes in the tree are indexed using preorder traversal.
//   - Each position in the vector represents a grid node in the tree and it
//   stores the size of the subtree rooted at that node.
//   - Each subtree is guaranteed to be contained in a single contiguous range;
//   i.e., for a given index `k`, the range [k, k + subtree_size[k]) in the
//   vector represents the data of the subtree rooted at grid node `k`.
//   - We can iterate over a node's children by skipping over their subtrees;
//   i.e., the first child of a node `k` is always at position `k+1`, the next
//   sibling comes `subtree_size[k+1]` positions later, and so on.

// A subtree is represented by a pointer to the entire grid tree and the index
// of the subtree's root. In order to iterate over the siblings of a subtree we
// need to store the index of the next sibling of its parent, aka the parent's
// end index, so that we don't traverse outside of the parent's subtree.
//
// In the example above, we can compute the next sibling of a subtree rooted at
// index 2 by adding its subtree size (2 + 3 = 5). However, when we compute the
// next sibling for the subtree at index 5, by adding its subtree size (5 + 2)
// it's equal to its parent's next sibling (aka parent's end index), so we can
// determine that such subtree doesn't have a next sibling.
