  // is inserted, the second line will be marked as a bidirectional isolate,
  // so that its direction is determined by the leading text on the line
  // rather than whatever is "left over" from the first line. We find this
  // produces a much more visually appealing and less confusing result than
  // inheriting the preceding directionality.
