FAIL TextTrack.activeCues, after addCue() assert_equals: t1.activeCues should return same object expected null but got object "[object TextTrackCueList]"
FAIL TextTrack.activeCues, different modes assert_equals: t1.activeCues should return the same object after setting mode to showing expected null but got object "[object TextTrackCueList]"
FAIL TextTrack.activeCues, video loading assert_equals: t1.activeCues should return the same object after loading a video expected null but got object "[object TextTrackCueList]"
