# BEFORE ADDING A TEST HERE: If this is a consistent failure in Chrome on
# ChromeOS CI builders, you should try to find and revert CLs causing new
# regressions. Do not simply disable newly failing tests in tast_control.gni
# as the Chrome uprev will still fail.
#
# Chromimum sheriffs should not disable NEW regressions here. Changes to
# this file require the current CrOS gardener's approval. See go/chrome-sheriff-tast.

# WARNING: if you wish to disable a tast test that runs in a ChromeOS SDK
# build, this is the wrong file to edit. You need to mark those tests as
# "informational" in their source .go files.

# To disable a specific test in chrome_all_tast_tests, add the name of the test
# to the following list and cite a bug.
#
# To disable the test only on a specific board, add an at-mark ( @ ) and the
# board name at the end of the entry (eg. "login.Chrome@kevin" disables
# "login.Chrome" test only on "kevin" device). An asterisk is not supported in
# the board name.
#
# As a last resort, you can use an asterisk ( * ) in an entry -- matches every
# substring (eg. "crostini.*" disables the all tests that names are starting
# with "crostini.").
# WARNING: This may cause unexpected disablement and is strongly discouraged.
# You should specify the tests one-by-one in most cases, instead of this.
