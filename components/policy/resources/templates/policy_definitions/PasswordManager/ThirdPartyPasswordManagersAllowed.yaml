caption: Allow using Third-Party Password Managers in
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> on
  <ph name="ANDROID_NAME">Android</ph>
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to true lets users use a third-party password manager.
  That password manager will handle saving and filling for all password, payment
  and autofill data.
  When the policy is true or not set, a setting will allow to switch between
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>'s buit-in password
  manager and the password manager configured in Android settings.
  Since <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> uses the same data
  as Autofill with Google, the setting can only be changed to use third-party
  password managers if a manager other than Autofill with Google is configured
  in Android's system settings.

  Setting the policy to false means
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will always use the
  built-in password manager.

  This policy doesn't affect third-party password managers that use
  accessibility APIs.
