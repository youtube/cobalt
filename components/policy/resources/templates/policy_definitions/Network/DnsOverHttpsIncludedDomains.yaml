caption: Specify domains to be resolved using DNS-over-HTTPS
desc: |-
  List of domains to be resolved using DNS-over-HTTPS. Other domains not included in the list will not be resolved using DNS-over-HTTPS. This policy is ignored when the secure DNS mode is set to off (always use plain-text DNS).

  If the list is empty or unset, all domains will be resolved using DNS-over-HTTPS whenever possible. This is the same behavior with an included domains list with the value of ["*"].

  If <ph name="DOH_TEMPLATES_POLICY_NAME">DnsOverHttpsExcludedDomains</ph> is also set, a more specific domain is preferred. Specificity refers to the number of dots ('.') in the domain. When a domain matches both policies, default to use DNS-over-HTTPS for the domain.

  The domains are expected to be in the form of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or as domain suffixes noted using a special wildcard prefix '*'.

  Incorrectly formatted domains will be ignored.
