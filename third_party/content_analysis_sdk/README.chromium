Description:
The Google Chrome Content Analysis Connector provides an official mechanism
allowing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) agents to more deeply integrate their
services with Google Chrome.

DLP agents are background processes on managed computers that allow enterprises
to monitor locally running applications for data exfiltration events. They can
allow/block these activities based on customer defined DLP policies.
