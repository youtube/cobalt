caption: Enable Chrome Cleanup on Windows
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means Chrome Cleanup periodically scans the system for unwanted software and should any be found, will ask the user if they wish to remove it. Manually triggering Chrome Cleanup from chrome://settings is allowed.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means Chrome Cleanup won't periodically scan and manual triggering is disabled.

        On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft速 Windows速</ph>, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft速 Active Directory速</ph> domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.
