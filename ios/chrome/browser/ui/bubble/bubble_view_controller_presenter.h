// and the user taps the tab switcher button shortly after, `userEngaged` would
// be `YES` because the user has recently seen the bubble and can reasonably be
// assumed to be influenced by it. However, if a bubble appears in the same
// scenario, but the user ignores it and doesn't click the tab switcher button
// until significantly later, `userEngaged` will be `NO` because it is unlikely
// the bubble had an effect on the user's action.
