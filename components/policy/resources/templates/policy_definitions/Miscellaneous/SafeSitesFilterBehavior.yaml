caption: Control SafeSites adult content filtering.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy controls the SafeSites URL filter, which uses the Google Safe Search API to classify URLs as pornographic or not.

  When this policy is set to:

  * Do not filter sites for adult content, or not set, sites aren't filtered

  * Filter sites for adult content, pornographic sites are filtered

  The policy applies to both the URL the user navigates to and to iframes. The <ph name="URL_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">URLAllowlist</ph> policy takes precedence over this policy and can be used to override verdicts from the Google Safe Search API.
