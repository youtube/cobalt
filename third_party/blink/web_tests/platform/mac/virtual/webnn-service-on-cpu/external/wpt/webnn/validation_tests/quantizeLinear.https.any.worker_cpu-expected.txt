This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] [quantizeLinear] Test scale's shape = [3, 2, 5] and zeroPoint's shape = [3, 2, 5] which is the same as input's shape.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int8 for input operand named 'zeroPoint', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [quantizeLinear] Test scale's shape = [5] and zeroPoint's shape = [5] which is unidirectionally broadcastable to input's shape.
