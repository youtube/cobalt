# Collaboration

This component contains functionality for collaboration groups.

## Testing

To run all the relevant C++ unit tests, you can run the `components_unittests`
target and give the `collaboration` filter file as an argument:

```
./out/Default/components_unittests --test-launcher-filter-file=components/collaboration/components_unittests.filter
```
