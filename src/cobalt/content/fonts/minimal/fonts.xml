    NOTE: Families with a "fallback" value of "true" are added to the fallback
    list, regardless of whether or not they are named. Fallback fonts are chosen
    based on a match: full BCP-47 language tag including script, then just
    language, and finally order (the first font containing the glyph). Order of
    appearance is also the tiebreaker for weight matching.

    The pages attribute indicates which character pages are contained within
    the font. It is used with character fallback to allow the system to quickly
    determine that a character cannot appear in a font without requiring the
    full character map to be loaded into memory. Character pages are zero
    indexed, and each page contains 256 characters, so character 1000 would be
    contained within page 3.
