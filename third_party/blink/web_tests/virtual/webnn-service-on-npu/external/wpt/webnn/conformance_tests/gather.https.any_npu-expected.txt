This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] gather float32 1D tensor and uint32 0D scalar indices default options
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Unsupported data type, input 'indices' data type uint32 must be one of [int32]."
[FAIL] gather float32 1D tensor and int64 0D scalar indices default options
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Unsupported data type, constant 'indices' data type int64 must be one of [float32,float16,int32,uint32,int8,uint8,int4,uint4]."
[FAIL] gather float32 2D tensor and int32 0D out-of-bound positive indices default options
  assert_true: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test gather float32 actual -66.05901336669922 should be close enough to expected 90.2870101928711 by the acceptable 0 ULP distance, but they have 2150659260 ULP distance expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
