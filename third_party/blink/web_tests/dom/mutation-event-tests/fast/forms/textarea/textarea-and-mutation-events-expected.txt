CONSOLE WARNING: Listener added for a synchronous 'DOMNodeInserted' DOM Mutation Event. This event type is deprecated (https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#legacy-event-types) and work is underway to remove it from this browser. Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a risk of future incompatibility. Consider using MutationObserver instead.
Tests to see if registering an empty DOMNodeInserted event handler and dirtying the tree just right can cause attach re-entrancy with textarea.

Passes if doesn't crash.
