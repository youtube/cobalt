This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS datachannel bufferedAmount initial value should be 0 for both peers
PASS datachannel bufferedAmount should increase to byte length of encodedunicode string sent
PASS datachannel bufferedAmount should stay at zero for empty string sent
PASS datachannel bufferedAmount should increase to byte length of buffer sent
PASS datachannel bufferedAmount should stay at zero for empty buffer sent
FAIL datachannel bufferedAmount should increase to size of blob sent promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
FAIL datachannel bufferedAmount should stay at zero for empty blob sent promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
FAIL datachannel bufferedAmount should increase by byte length for each message sent promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
PASS datachannel bufferedAmount should not decrease immediately after initiating closure
PASS datachannel bufferedAmount should not decrease after closing the peer connection
PASS datachannel bufferedamountlow event fires after send() is complete
PASS datachannel bufferedamount is data.length on send(data)
PASS datachannel bufferedamount returns the same amount if no more data is
PASS datachannel bufferedamountlow event fires only once after multiple consecutive send() calls
PASS datachannel bufferedamountlow event fires after each sent message
PASS negotiated datachannel bufferedAmount initial value should be 0 for both peers
PASS negotiated datachannel bufferedAmount should increase to byte length of encodedunicode string sent
PASS negotiated datachannel bufferedAmount should stay at zero for empty string sent
PASS negotiated datachannel bufferedAmount should increase to byte length of buffer sent
PASS negotiated datachannel bufferedAmount should stay at zero for empty buffer sent
