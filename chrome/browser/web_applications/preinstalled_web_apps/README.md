This directory contains hard coded preinstalled web app configs to be default
installed in Chrome branded builds.

### Configs

Preinstalled web apps are configured in two ways:
- A hard coded set of apps in
  [`GetPreinstalledWebApps()`](preinstalled_web_apps.h).
- JSON configs on device:
  - Command line arg `--preinstalled-web-apps-dir`
    - Only used for testing.
    - Works on all platforms.
  - [`chrome::DIR_STANDALONE_EXTERNAL_EXTENSIONS`](https://source.chromium.org/search?q=DIR_STANDALONE_EXTERNAL_EXTENSIONS)/web_apps
    - Chrome OS only (ozone included).
    - `/usr/share/google-chrome/extensions/web_apps` for branded builds.
    - `/usr/share/chromium/extensions/web_apps` for unbranded builds.
    - Configs come from:
      https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chromeos/overlays/chromeos-overlay/+/main/chromeos-base/chromeos-default-apps
  - Command line arg `--extra-web-apps-dir`
    - Used as subdirectory of above directory.
    - Chrome OS only.
    - Used by specific board images to add board specific default web apps.

### Icons

The icon bitmaps bundled with the configs are not suitable to include in an open
source repository and are stored in an internal repo:
https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chrome/components/default_apps.git

This internal repo only gets checked out for internal Chromium checkouts.

Icon bitmaps get checked out at:
`chrome/browser/resources/preinstalled_web_apps/internal`

Icons are packaged into the build via:
[`chrome/browser/resources/preinstalled_web_apps/resources.grd`](../../resources/preinstalled_web_apps/resources.grd)
