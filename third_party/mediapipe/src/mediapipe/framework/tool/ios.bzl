# When the static framework is built with bazel, the all header files are moved
# to the "Headers" directory with no header path prefixes. This auxiliary rule
# is used for stripping the path prefix to the C/iOS API header files included by
# other C/iOS API header files.
# In case of C header files, includes start with a keyword of "#include'.
# Imports in iOS header files start with a keyword of '#import'.

      hdr_labels: List of header labels to strip out the include path. Each
          label must end with a colon followed by the header file name.
      prefix: Optional prefix path to prepend to the header inclusion path.
