// H5vcc stands for "HTML5 Video Container for Consoles".
//
// The H5vcc node acts as a Javascript namespace collecting various disparate
// APIs which allow clients to call non-standard native functions that we
// expose.
//
// For example we provide a h5vcc.storage.ClearCookies(), which can empty the
// cookie jar in response to the user's request. Other H5vcc modules expose
// audio capabilities about the platform, or run an in-app DIAL server.
//
// The H5vcc node should just be a collection of readonly sub-nodes.
// This is created by the BrowserModule and passed directly to the Window
// during construction.

// Note: every attribute defined here must have a corresponding interface idl
// file included in BUILD.gn unconditionally, even if there is
// a condition before the declaration of the attribute.
