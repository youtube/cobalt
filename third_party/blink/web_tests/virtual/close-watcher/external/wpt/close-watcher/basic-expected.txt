PASS Esc key does not count as user activation, so it fires close but not cancel
PASS destroy() then close via Esc key fires no events
PASS Esc key then destroy() fires only one close event
PASS close via synthesized escape key should not work
PASS destroy inside oncancel
PASS destroy inside onclose is benign
PASS close inside oncancel should not trigger an infinite loop
PASS close inside onclose should not trigger an infinite loop
