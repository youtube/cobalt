caption: URLs that will be granted access to audio capture devices without prompt
desc: |-
  Setting the policy means you specify the URL list whose patterns get matched to the security origin of the requesting URL. A match grants access to audio capture devices without prompt

        For detailed information on valid <ph name="URL_LABEL">url</ph> patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. Note, however, that the pattern "*", which matches any URL, is not supported by this policy.
