# Defines a Fuchsia component.
# See: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/glossary#component
#
# A component is defined by a component manifest.
# A component is a unit of executable software on Fuchsia. When the componet is executed, there are usually many files
# needed at runtime, such as the executable itself, shared libraries, and possibly other data resources. These files are
# specified by using the GN concept of "data_deps".
#
# Components are distributed using a fuchsia package which can contain multiple components. The component manifest and
# the runtime dependencies of the component are packaged using the fuchsia_package rule.
#
# By default, the runtime depenencies of the component are included in the package using relative paths calcualted from
# the "closest" root of: $root_gen_dir, $root_dir, $out_dir. If a specific path is desired in the package, the "resources" parameter can
# be used to explicitly specify the path of a specific file.
#
# A component is launched by a URL which identifies the package and the component manifest.
# See: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/glossary#component_url
#
# Example
#
# ```
#   fuchsia_component("my_component") {
#      manifest = "meta/component-manifest.cml"
#      resources = [
#        {
#          path = "testdata/use_case1.json"
#          dest = "data/testdata/use_case1.json"
#        },
#      ]
#      data_deps = [ ":hello_world_executable"]
#   }
# ```
#
# Parameters
#
#   data_deps
#     The labels of targets that generate the files needed at runtime by the component.
#     At minimum, this should include the label of the binary to include in the component.
#
#     Type: list of labels
#
#   manifest [optional]
#     The source manifest file for this component.
#
#     Type: string (filepath)
#
#   manifest_output_name [optional]
#     The name of the manifest file contained in the distribution that this
#     component is included in. The output name should have no extension or
#     prefixes. The resulting filename will have the ".cm" extension.
#     For example, if `manifest` is "foo.cml" and `manifest_output_name` is "bar",
#     the filename will be "bar.cm".
#
#     Type: string
#     Default: The base file name of `manifest` without an extension.
#
#   resources [optional]
#     Lists additional files to include for runtime access by the component.
#     Defines the resources in a package containing this component. A resource
#     is a data file that may be produced by the build system, checked in to a
#     source repository, or produced by another system that runs before the
#     build. Resources are placed in the `data/` directory of the assembled
#     package.
#
#     Type: list of scopes.  Entries in a scope in the resources list:
#       path (required)
#             Location of resource in source or build directory. If the
#             resource is checked in, this will typically be specified
#             as a path relative to the BUILD.gn file containing the
#             `package()` target. If the resource is generated, this will
#             typically be specified relative to `$target_gen_dir`.
#
#        dest (required) string (path) Location the resource will be placed within `data/`.
#
#   cm_label [optional]
#     Use label of a fuchsia_component_manifest target instead of supplying the manifest source.
#     Type: string, GN label e.g. `:my-manifest`
#
#   manifest_deps [optional]
#     Dependencies for the component's manifest, in case it is generated by another target.
#     Type: list of targets
#
#   required_offers (optional)
#     [list of strings] The set of protocols that should be offered to every child.
#
#   required_uses (optional)
#     [list of strings] The set of protocols that each child must use.
#
#   Standard parameters:
#     data_deps
#     deps
#     testonly
#     visibility
#
#   Metadata
#     contents - list of scopes describing files for this component. This metadata is consumed by
#       The fuchsia_package rule, which describes the entries used.
#       Entries in scope:
#         type: the usage type of the element, manifest or resource.
#                Each type can have specific properties included in the scope.
#         source [type == manifest || resource] The compiled manifest file to include in
#           the package for this component.
#         output_name [type == manifest] The basename of the manifest as it should appear in the package.
#         manifest_version [type == manifest]
#       dest: [type == resource] The package relative path of the resource.
