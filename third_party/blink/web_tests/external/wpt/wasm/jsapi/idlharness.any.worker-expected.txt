  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "toFixedLengthBuffer" missing
[FAIL] Memory interface: operation toResizableBuffer()
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "toResizableBuffer" missing
[FAIL] Memory interface: [object WebAssembly.Memory] must inherit property "toFixedLengthBuffer()" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "toFixedLengthBuffer" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Memory interface: [object WebAssembly.Memory] must inherit property "toResizableBuffer()" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "toResizableBuffer" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
