Description:
The Android NDK provides libraries and tools necessary for building, running,
and debugging C/C++ on Android. However, as Chromium builds it's own toolchain,
this directory only contains the following artifacts from the NDK:

1. simpleperf
2. sysroot
3. lldb and lldb-server

This allows us to use tracing and gdb support, while limiting our dependencies.

How to upgrade NDK:
1. Assign `_URL` variable in `3pp/fetch.py` to point to the new file. Edit
   `README.chromium` and `3pp/install.sh` as needed. Commit.
2. The builder for CIPD packagers
https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/ci/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
   should run (trigger if needed) with the commit. Wait for it to finish.
3. The `fetch.py` change leads to version code change, which triggers update in
   "latest" entry for the page:
https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/p/chromium/third_party/android_toolchain/android_toolchain
4. Copy the full hash from the above. Open `/DEPS`, under the
   `src/third_party/android_toolchain/ndk` entry, update `packages` ->
   `version` value with the full hash. Commit.
5. `gclient sync` on updated Chromium repo will pull in the updated NDK.

Local Modifications:
* Removed files in the sysroot that conflict with other files when unzipped on
  case-insensitive filesystems (e.g. usr/include/netfilter/xt_CONNMARK.h).
