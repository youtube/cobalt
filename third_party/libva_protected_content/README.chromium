Description:
This contains a header file supplied by Intel that is used for protected content
functionality with libva. All the functional pieces are contained within libva
and the corresponding driver implementation beneath libva. The entrypoints,
attributes and buffers defined here are passed through by libva to the driver
implementation which utilizes these as part of a closed source implementation
for Chrome OS for playing back protected content.
