// On iOS, EarlGrey tests can't serve a valid HTTPS response due to platform
// restrictions, so it's not possible to reliably use https:// URLs in Insecure
// Form Warning tests. Also, the test server serves URLs over 127.0.01 which is
// a trustworthy URL. This prevents serving a form over HTTPS and having it post
// to an insecure URL on iOS.
//
// To work around this, this function sets two ports for tests:
// - A form whose source URL's port is `source_url_port_treated_as_secure` will
//   be treated as an HTTPS URL in IsInsecureFormSourceAndAction().
// - A form whose action URL's port is `action_url_port_treated_as_insecure`
//   will be treated as an insecure URL in IsInsecureFormSourceAndAction().
//
// This allows us to use the test server on iOS and have the form's source and
// action URLs as 127.0.0.1:<port>.
