[FAIL] gatherND float32 4D input and 1D minimum indices
  assert_less_than_equal: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test gatherND float32 actual 0 should be close enough to expected -66.05901336669922 by ULP distance: expected a number less than or equal to 0n but got 1115954743n
[FAIL] gatherND float32 2D input and 2D negative indices
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': TFLite doesn't support to gather input into one dimension."
[FAIL] gatherND float32 1D input and 2D out-of-bounds indices
