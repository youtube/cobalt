# C++ Styleguide

This directory contains C++-specific pieces of Chromium's styleguide, including
the [guide itself](c++.md), a
[supplemental set of optional guidance](c++-dos-and-donts.md), and the list of
[allowed C++ language/library features](c++-features.md). To discuss anything in
here, email cxx@chromium.org or ask #cxx on
[Slack](/docs/website/site/developers/slack/index.md).
