   Note that this policy is deprecated in M87 and removed in M89. Please use <ph name="MANAGED_GUEST_SESSION_PRIVACY_WARNINGS_POLICY_NAME">ManagedGuestSessionPrivacyWarningsEnabled</ph> to configure the privacy warnings of managed-guest sessions instead.

        Control the auto launch notification of the managed guest session on <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>.

        If this policy is set to True, the privacy warning notification will be closed after some seconds.

        If the policy is set to False or not set, the privacy warning notification will be pinned until the user dismisses it.
