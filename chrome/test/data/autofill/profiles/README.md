The JSON files in this directory contains descriptions of profiles intended for
manual testing. They can be imported using the following command line flag:
```
--autofill-profiles-for-manual-testing=path/to/json
```
This overwrites all existing profiles permanently. It is therefore
recommended to use a temporary user data dir: `--user-data-dir=/tmp/...`
