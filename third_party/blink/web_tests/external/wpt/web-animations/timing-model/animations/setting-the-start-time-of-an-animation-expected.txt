This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Validate different value types that can be used to set start time
  assert_throws_js: function "() => {\n    animation.startTime = CSSNumericValue.parse("30%");\n  }" threw object "NotSupportedError: Failed to set the 'startTime' property on 'Animation': Invalid startTime. CSSNumericValue must be either a number or a time value for time based animations." ("NotSupportedError") expected instance of function "function TypeError() { [native code] }" ("TypeError")

[PASS] Setting the start time resolves a pending ready promise
[PASS] Setting the start time resolves a pending pause task
[PASS] Setting an unresolved start time on a play-pending animation makes it paused
[PASS] Setting the start time updates the finished state
[PASS] Setting the start time of a play-pending animation applies a pending playback rate
