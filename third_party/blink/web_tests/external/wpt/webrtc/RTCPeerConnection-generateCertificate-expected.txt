PASS generateCertificate() with compulsary ECDSA parameters should succeed
PASS generateCertificate() with invalid string algorithm should reject with NotSupportedError
PASS generateCertificate() with invalid algorithm dict should reject with NotSupportedError
PASS generateCertificate() with valid expires parameter should succeed
PASS generateCertificate() with 0 expires parameter should generate expired cert
FAIL generateCertificate() with invalid range for expires should reject with TypeError assert_unreached: Should have rejected: undefined Reached unreachable code
