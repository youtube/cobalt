// library registration process on Android.

// However, when the system is compiled with component build,
// command_buffer_gles2 library and this test runner share the globals, such
// as AtExitManager and JVM references.  When command_buffer_gles2 is run with
// the test runner, the globals may be populated.  Any other app linking to
// command_buffer_gles2 of course can not provide the globals.

// When the system is compiled without component build, command_buffer_gles2
// gets its own globals, while the test runner gets its own. The runner
// initialize different global variables than the ones command_buffer_gles2
// library uses. For example, there should be a global AtExitManager for the
// test runner, and there should be a global AtExitManager that the library
// uses. Similarly, if the test runner would use JNI, it should have global
// reference to the JNI environent. If the command_buffer_gles2 library would
// use JNI, it should have its own global reference to the JNI that always
// remains null. The reference of the library should always stay null, since
// JNI is not part of command_buffer_gles2 exported API (EGL API), and thus
// there is no way for the client of the library to populate the JNI
// pointer. The client may not even be a Java app.

// We signify that the globals have been initialized when running
// the component build.
