caption: Allow the device to request powerwash
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets a device trigger powerwash.

        Setting the policy to Disabled doesn't let a device trigger powerwash. An exception to still allow a powerwash can occur if <ph name="TPM_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_SETTINGS_NAME">TPMFirmwareUpdateSettings</ph> is set to a value that lets the TPM firmware update, but it hasn't updated yet.
