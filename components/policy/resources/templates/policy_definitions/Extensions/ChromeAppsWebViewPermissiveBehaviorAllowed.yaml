caption: Restore permissive Chrome Apps <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph> behavior

desc: |-
  Chrome Apps <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph> allows for
  behavior which is in the process of being removed from
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

  The previous behavior would show an interstitial page if a
  <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph> were to navigate to a page
  with an invalid SSL certificate. This interstitial gives the user the option
  to unsafely proceed. The new behavior shows an error page without the option
  to unsafely proceed.

  The previous behaviour also allows the
  <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph>
  <ph name="NEWWINDOW_EVENT_NAME">newwindow</ph> event
  (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webviewTag/#event-newwindow)
  to attach the new window to a <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph>
  element in a separate App window from the originating
  <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph>. With the new behavior, this
  attachment is still allowed, however the window reference returned from the
  call to <ph name="WINDOW_OPEN_NAME">window.open</ph> in the originating
  <ph name="WEBVIEW_TAG_NAME">&lt;webview&gt;</ph> is invalidated.

  If enabled, the previous behavior is used.
  If disabled or unset, the behavior change takes effect as it is rolled
  out through the <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>
  release process.

  This policy is a temporary workaround in the event that enterprises
  experience breakage due to these changes. This policy will be removed
  in version 117.

# On ChromeOS, this policy should reach an LTS release before being removed.
# TODO(crbug.com/1261928): The supported_on range is intended to be 113-116,
# but until_version doesn't allow future versions. In M117, set the
# until_version and remove the supporting code.
supported_on:
- chrome.*:113-
- chrome_os:113-
- fuchsia:113-

supported_chrome_os_management: ['google_cloud', 'active_directory']

# While this policy on its own could be dynamic, the GuestView MPArch
# migration (crbug.com/1261928), which depends on this policy being disabled,
# would not be able to handle dynamic changes.
