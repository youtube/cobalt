Description:
libusbx provides a platform-agnostic API for accessing the USB subsystem on Mac,

- Added libusb_get_raw_config_descriptor and libusb_get_active_config_value
  methods to avoid using the built-in parser.
- Removed OSAtomic calls from darwin_usb.c for macOS compatibility by
  backporting and simplifying the 10.12 branch of the upstream
  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libusb/+/1e05092aa98d60c717929629ac16590595e08431
  as the 10.12 branch works fine on all previous OSes.
