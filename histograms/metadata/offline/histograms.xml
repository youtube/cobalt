  <owner>dimich@chromium.org</owner>

  <summary>
    Records events related to click through rate (CTR) calculation for Offline
    Indicator UI. The CTR can be calculated by computing Clicked/Displayed.

<histogram name="OfflineIndicator.ShownDurationV2" units="ms"
    expires_after="2022-04-17">
  <owner>curranmax@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>tbansal@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The duration the offline indicator was shown. Recorded when the offline
    indicator stops being shown. There are two differences between this
    histogram and OfflineIndicator.ShownDuration: 1) the maximum bucket size and
    total number of buckets are higher in this histogram, and 2) this histogram
    is persisted in perfs. The second point means that if the user backgrounds
    then kills Chrome when the Offline Indicator was shown, then we will still
    record a sample. Note that in this case, when the user opens Chrome again
    and if the Offline Indicator is shown, then it will be treated as a
    continuation from before Chrome was killed.

    units="ms" expires_after="2022-05-01">
  <owner>curranmax@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>tbansal@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The duration the offline indicator was shown and Chrome was in the
    foreground. Samples are only recorded to this histogram if Chrome was never
    in the background while the offline indicator was shown. This is recoreded
    when the offline indicator stops being shown. The data for this histogram is
    persisted in perfs, so if Chrome is killed, then we will still record a
    sample. Note that in this case, when the user opens Chrome again and the
    offline indicator is shown, then it will be treated as a continuation from
    before Chrome was killed.

  <summary>
    The number of times Chrome was backgrounded while the offline indicator was
    shown. This is recorded every time the offline indicator stops being shown.
    The data for this histogram is persisted in perfs, so if Chrome is killed,
    then we will still record a sample. Note that in this case, when the user
    opens Chrome again and the offline indicator is shown, then it will be
    treated as a continuation from before Chrome was killed.

    tab is checked.

  <owner>curranmax@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>tbansal@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether or not the OfflinePageNavigationThrottle canceled a navigation
    request. Requests are only canceled if and only if the navigation request
    was initiated by the renderer and the request headers contain the
    &quot;X-Chrome-offline&quot; header.

    This histogram is recorded each time Chrome tries to create an
    OfflinePageNavigationThrottle, which only happens on Android (since Offline
    Pages is only enabled there).

  <summary>
    Upon starting saving a new last_n offline page snapshot, report if that is
    being done for a page that is new (a navigation happened) or for one that
    has been previously saved in the same session (no navigation happened). This
    metric will assist in determining if there is the need to better track
    actual content changes in pages saved more than once by last_n.
  </summary>

<histogram name="OfflinePages.OfflineUsage" enum="OfflinePagesOfflineUsage"
    expires_after="2023-08-13">
  <owner>dimich@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>offline-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Counts user-days when Chrome was used in specific ways regarding navigation
    to online and offline content. Buckets are mutually exclusive so that only
    one bucket is incremented per reported day. This metric is not recorded to
    UMA immediately due to potential data loss while offline. So day counters
    are persisted to prefs and reported to the histogram only when the next UMA
    data upload is likely to succeed. For more details see:
    https://goo.gl/GJXwFe.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflinePages.OfflineUsage.NotOfflineResilient"
    enum="OfflinePagesOfflineUsage" expires_after="2022-04-17">
  <owner>sclittle@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>offline-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Counts user-days when Chrome was used in specific ways regarding navigation
    to online and offline content. Buckets are mutually exclusive so that only
    one bucket is incremented per reported day.

    This metric is a mirror of OfflinePages.OfflineUsage but it doesn't use any
    of the offline resilient mechanisms that one has. Ideally both should report
    exactly the same values but it is expected this one will lose more samples.
  </summary>

    period used for expiring temporary pages. This metric is recorded when an
    offline page is accessed.

    enum="OfflinePagesPublishSource" expires_after="M85">

<histogram name="OfflinePages.SavePage.PercentLoaded" units="%"
    expires_after="M77">

    inner working.

    expires_after="2021-06-25">
  <owner>sclittle@chromium.org</owner>
