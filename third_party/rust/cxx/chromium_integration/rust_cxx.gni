# Template to build Rust/C++ bindings using the tooling
# described at https://cxx.rs.
#
# (Specifically, this builds the C++ side of the bindings.
# The Rust side of the bindings are not 'built' as such, but
# automatically expanded by the Rust compiler by virtue of a
# proc macro which is a simple dependency relationship on the
# Rust target).
#
# This template expands to a source_set containing the
# C++ side of the bindings. Simply treat it as a dependency.
#
# If you're using this, consider whether you should be using
# rust_static_library.gni or mixed_static_library.gni which have
# facilities to do the same code generation in an easier
# way.
#
# Parameters:
#
# sources:
#   The .rs files containing a #[cxx::bridge] section.
#
# deps (optional)
#   C++ targets on which the headers depend in order to build
#   successfully.
#
# export_symbols
#   Whether the C++ side of the bindings should be exported
#   from any shared objects in which it finds itself.
#   This is not necessary if the Rust and C++ side of the
#   bindings will always find themselves within the same binary,
#   which is usually the case in a non-component build.
#   Even in a component build, the Rust and C++ code will
#   often find itself within the same binary and no exporting
#   is required. However, there may be other binaries - most
#   commonly Rust unit test executables - which contain the
#   Rust side of the bindings but not the C++ side. In such
#   a case, it's important that the C++ side symbols are
#   exported such that the Rust unit tests can link against
#   them. This does the equivalent of adding BASE_EXPORT
#   or similar.
#   Example:
#     Non-component build:
#       group of libfoo.a, foo.rlib # contain
#          # C++ and Rust side bindings, always both linked
#          # into final targets
#       foo_rs_unittests # contains Rust side bindings,
#          # and any C++ dependencies which will include
#          # all of the libfoo code.
#     Component build:
#       libfoo.so # contains C++ and Rust side bindings
#       foo_rs_unittests # contains Rust side test code,
#          # but links against libfoo.so to get the C++
#          # side bindings. So libfoo.so must make those
#          # symbols visible.
