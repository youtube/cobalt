        Determines whether <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> keeps local account data after logout. If set to true, no persistent account data are kept by <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> and all data from the user session will be discarded after logout.
