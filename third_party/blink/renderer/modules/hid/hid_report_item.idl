// The HID specification allows a device to specify units in one of four
// standard unit systems. A device may also specify it is not using units, or is
// using a vendor-defined unit system. Each unit system corresponds to a set of
// units for length, mass, time, temperature, current, and luminous intensity.
// See the units table in section 6.2.2.7 of the Device Class Definition for
// HID, v1.11.
