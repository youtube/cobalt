The legacy_crx_packge.crx file is a CRX that was packed in a legacy format.
Modern Chrome packages extensions in CRX3. But we still need to validate that
we support older CRXs packages, at least for the time being.

Since Chrome no longer writes older versions of CRX files, this package cannot
be updated.
