  Tab Compare is an AI-powered tool for comparing information across a user's tabs. As an example, the feature can be offered to the user when multiple tabs with products in a similar category are open.

  0 = Allow the feature to be used, while allowing Google to use relevant data to improve its AI models. Relevant data may include prompts, inputs, outputs, source materials, and written feedback, depending on the feature. It may also be reviewed by humans to improve AI models. 0 is the default value, except when noted below.

  1 = Allow the feature to be used, but does not allow Google to improve models using users' content (including prompts, inputs, outputs, source materials, and written feedback). 1 is the default value for Enterprise users managed by <ph name="GOOGLE_ADMIN_CONSOLE_PRODUCT_NAME">Google Admin console</ph> and for Education accounts managed by <ph name="GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_PRODUCT_NAME">Google Workspace</ph>.

  2 = Do not allow the feature.

  If the policy is unset, its behavior is determined by the <ph name="GEN_AI_DEFAULT_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">GenAiDefaultSettings</ph> policy.
