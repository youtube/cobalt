caption: Disable CNAME lookup when negotiating Kerberos authentication
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled skips CNAME lookup. The server name is used as entered when generating the Kerberos SPN.

        Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means CNAME lookup determines the canonical name of the server when generating the Kerberos SPN.
