This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL addTrack, then sRD(simulcast recv offer) results in simulcast assert_equals: expected 1 but got 2
FAIL simulcast is not supported for audio assert_equals: expected 1 but got 2
FAIL sRD(recv simulcast answer) can narrow the simulcast envelope specified by addTransceiver assert_array_equals: expected property 0 to be 2 but got undefined (expected array [2] got [undefined])
FAIL sRD(recv simulcast answer) can narrow the simulcast envelope from a previous negotiation assert_array_equals: expected property 0 to be 2 but got undefined (expected array [2] got [undefined])
FAIL sRD(simulcast offer) can narrow the simulcast envelope from a previous negotiation assert_array_equals: [[SendEncodings]] is not updated in have-remote-offer for reoffers lengths differ, expected array ["foo", "bar"] length 2, got ["foo"] length 1
FAIL Duplicate rids in sRD(offer) are ignored assert_equals: expected 1 but got 2
FAIL Choices in rids in sRD(offer) are ignored assert_equals: expected 1 but got 2
FAIL addTrack, then rollback of sRD(simulcast offer), brings us back to having a single encoding without a rid assert_equals: expected 1 but got 2
FAIL sRD(simulcast offer), addTrack, then rollback brings us back to having a single encoding assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [undefined] length 1, got ["foo", "bar"] length 2
PASS Reordering of rids in sRD(answer) is ignored
PASS Reordering of rids in sRD(reanswer) is ignored
PASS Reordering of rids in sRD(reoffer) is ignored
FAIL Rollback of sRD(reoffer) with a single rid results in all previous encodings assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array ["foo", "bar"] length 2, got ["bar"] length 1
FAIL sRD(recv simulcast answer) can narrow the simulcast envelope specified by addTransceiver by removing the first encoding assert_array_equals: expected property 0 to be 1 but got undefined (expected array [1] got [undefined])
FAIL sRD(recv simulcast answer) can narrow the simulcast envelope from a previous negotiation by removing the first encoding assert_array_equals: expected property 0 to be 1 but got undefined (expected array [1] got [undefined])
FAIL sRD(simulcast offer) can narrow the simulcast envelope from a previous negotiation by removing the first encoding assert_array_equals: [[SendEncodings]] is not updated in have-remote-offer for reoffers lengths differ, expected array ["foo", "bar"] length 2, got ["bar"] length 1
PASS sender renegotiation to inactive does not disable simulcast
PASS sender renegotiation to recvonly does not disable simulcast
PASS receiver renegotiation to inactive does not disable simulcast
PASS receiver renegotiation to sendonly does not disable simulcast
Harness: the test ran to completion.
