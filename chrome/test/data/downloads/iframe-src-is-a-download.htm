This tests that we can serialize a page that has a downloaded url in an iframe without crashing.

<!-- iframe.src points to non-existing resource.
     in 45.0.2454.85 save-as-complete-html points the saved frame to
     a local/saved copy in foo_files/saved_resource.html which contains
     serialized contents of the built-in "The file or directory could
     not be found" page. -->
<iframe src="no-such-file.exe"></iframe>

<!-- iframe.src points to a "download".
     in 45.0.2454.85 save-as-complete-html points the saved frame to
     about:blank -->
<iframe src="thisdayinhistory.xls"></iframe>
