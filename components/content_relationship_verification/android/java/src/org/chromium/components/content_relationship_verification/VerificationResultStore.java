/**
 * Stores the results of Digital Asset Link verifications performed by {@link OriginVerifier}.
 *
 * There are two types of results stored - proper relationships that are stored in the Child-classes
 * and overrides that are stored in a static variable (therefore not persisted across
 * re-launches). Ideally, we will be able to get rid of the overrides in the future, they're just
 * here now for legacy reasons.
 *
 * Lifecycle: This class is a singleton, however you should constructor inject the singleton
 * instance to your classes where possible to make testing easier.
 * Thread safety: Methods can be called on any thread.
