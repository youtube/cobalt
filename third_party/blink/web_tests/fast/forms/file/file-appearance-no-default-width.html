    The purpose of this test is to exercise the codepath through
    FileUploadControlIntrinsicInlineSize that uses the non-min-default
    intrinsic size (default_label_width rather than min_default_label_width).
    Normally this codepath is only followed for (non-English) locales where the
    IDS_FORM_FILE_NO_FILE_LABEL string is long enough to exceed the minimum size.

    But since localization isn't fully supported in web_tests, here we construct
    a custom font where the '0' glyph takes up no space, which tricks
    FileUploadControlIntrinsicInlineSize into computing a minimum width of zero,
    thus using default_label_width in all cases.

    If this approach turns out to be problematic then this test can be deleted.
