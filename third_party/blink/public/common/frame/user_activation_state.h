// This class represents the user activation state of a frame.  It maintains two
// bits of information: whether this frame has ever seen an activation in its
// lifetime (the sticky bit), and whether this frame has a current activation
// that is neither expired nor consumed (the transient bit).  See User
// Activation v2 (UAv2) links below for more info.
//
//
// Tracking User Activation across the Frame Tree
// ==============================================
//
// This state changes in three ways: activation (of both bits) through user
// input notifications, and deactivation (of transient bit only) through expiry
// and consumption.
//
// - A notification update at a frame activates all ancestor frames (sets both
// bits to true).  Also see "Same-origin Visibility" below.
//
// - A consumption call deactivates the transient bits in the whole frame tree.
// This exhaustive consumption guarantees that a malicious subframe can't embed
// sub-subframes in a way that could allow multiple consumptions per user
// activation.
//
// - After a certain time limit (few seconds), the transient bit is deactivated.
// (Internally, the class doens't store the transient bit, but stores the bit's
// expiry time instead.)
//
//
// Same-origin Visibility of User Activation
// =========================================
//
// We launched UAv2 with a relaxed visibility model that a user activation is
// visible to all same-origin frames (w.r.t. the originally-activated frame), in
// addition to the ancestor frames as per UAv2.  We will remove this relaxation
// after implementing a mechanism for activation transfer
// (https://crbug.com/928838).
//
// Details: Before UAv2, user activation was visible to all same-process frames
// and no cross-process frames (undocumented).  The ancestor-only restriction
// with UAv2 caused a few breakages because of reliance on the old assumption,
// see the Type=Bug-Regression bugs blocking the above bug.  Once we have a
// workaround for those broken cases (most likely through a postMessage
// transfer), we will go back to the ancestor-only visibility model.
//
//
// State Replication in Browser and Renderers
// ==========================================
//
// The user activation state is replicated in the browser process (in
// |RenderFrameHostImpl|) and in the renderer processes (in |LocalFrame| and
// |RemoteFrame|).  The replicated states across the browser and renderer
// processes are kept in sync as follows:
//
// [A] Consumption of activation state for popups starts in the frame tree of
// the browser process and propagate to the renderer trees through direct IPCs
// (one IPC sent to each renderer).
//
// [B] Consumption calls from JS/blink side (e.g. video picture-in-picture)
// update the originating renderer's local frame tree and send an IPC to the
// browser; the browser updates its frame tree and sends IPCs to all other
// renderers each of which then updates its local frame tree.
//
// [B'] Notification updates on user inputs is like [B] (renderer first).  These
// should really be like [A] (browser first), see https://crbug.com/848778.
//
// [C] Expiration of an active state is tracked independently in each process.
