// Sandbox is a sandbox library for windows processes. Use when you want a
// 'privileged' process and a 'locked down process' to interact with.
// The privileged process is called the broker and it is started by external
// means (such as the user starting it). The 'sandboxed' process is called the
// target and it is started by the broker. There can be many target processes
// started by a single broker process. This library provides facilities
// for both the broker and the target.
//
// The design rationale and relevant documents can be found at http://go/sbox.
//
// Note: this header does not include the SandboxFactory definitions because
// there are cases where the Sandbox library is linked against the main .exe
// while its API needs to be used in a DLL.
