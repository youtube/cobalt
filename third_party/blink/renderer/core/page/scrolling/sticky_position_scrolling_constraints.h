// Encapsulates the constraint information for a position: sticky element and
// does calculation of the sticky offset for a given overflow clip rectangle.
//
// To avoid slowing down scrolling we cannot make the offset calculation a
// layout-inducing event. Instead constraint information is cached during layout
// and used as the scroll position changes to determine the current offset. In
// most cases the only information that is needed is the sticky element's layout
// rectangle and its containing block rectangle (both respective to the nearest
// ancestor scroller which the element is sticking to), and the set of sticky
// edge constraints (i.e. the distance from each edge the element should stick).
//
// For a given (non-cached) overflow clip rectangle, calculating the current
// offset in most cases just requires sliding the (cached) sticky element
// rectangle until it satisfies the (cached) sticky edge constraints for the
// overflow clip rectangle, whilst not letting the sticky element rectangle
// escape its (cached) containing block rect. For example, consider the
// following situation (where positions are relative to the scroll container):
//
//    +---------------------+ <-- Containing Block (150x70 at 10,0)
//    | +-----------------+ |
//    | |    top: 50px;   |<-- Sticky Box (130x10 at 20,0)
//    | +-----------------+ |
//    |                     |
//  +-------------------------+ <-- Overflow Clip Rectangle (170x60 at 0,50)
//  | |                     | |
//  | |                     | |
//  | +---------------------+ |
//  |                         |
//  |                         |
//  |                         |
//  +-------------------------+
//
// Here the cached sticky box would be moved downwards to try and be at position
// (20,100) - 50 pixels down from the top of the clip rectangle. However doing
// so would take it outside the cached containing block rectangle, so the final
// sticky position would be capped to (20,20).
//
// Unfortunately this approach breaks down in the presence of nested sticky
// elements, as the cached locations would be moved by ancestor sticky elements.
// Consider:
//
//  +------------------------+ <-- Outer sticky (top: 10px, 150x50 at 0,0)
//  |  +------------------+  |
//  |  |                  | <-- Inner sticky (top: 25px, 100x20 at 20,0)
//  |  +------------------+  |
//  |                        |
//  +------------------------+
//
// Assume the overflow clip rectangle is centered perfectly over the outer
// sticky. We would then want to move the outer sticky element down by 10
// pixels, and the inner sticky element down by only 15 pixels - because it is
// already being shifted by its ancestor. To correctly handle such situations we
// apply more complicated logic which is explained in the implementation of
// |ComputeStickyOffset|.
