This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] idl_test setup
[PASS] idl_test validation
[PASS] Partial interface UIEvent: original interface defined
[PASS] Partial interface UIEvent: member names are unique
[PASS] Partial dictionary UIEventInit: original dictionary defined
[PASS] Partial dictionary UIEventInit: member names are unique
[PASS] Partial interface UIEvent[2]: member names are unique
[PASS] Partial interface UIEvent[3]: member names are unique
[PASS] Partial dictionary UIEventInit[2]: member names are unique
[PASS] InputDeviceCapabilities interface: existence and properties of interface object
[PASS] InputDeviceCapabilities interface object length
[PASS] InputDeviceCapabilities interface object name
[PASS] InputDeviceCapabilities interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
[PASS] InputDeviceCapabilities interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
[PASS] InputDeviceCapabilities interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
[PASS] InputDeviceCapabilities interface: attribute firesTouchEvents
[FAIL] InputDeviceCapabilities interface: attribute pointerMovementScrolls
  assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "pointerMovementScrolls" expected true got false
[PASS] InputDeviceCapabilities must be primary interface of new InputDeviceCapabilities
[PASS] Stringification of new InputDeviceCapabilities
[PASS] InputDeviceCapabilities interface: new InputDeviceCapabilities must inherit property "firesTouchEvents" with the proper type
[FAIL] InputDeviceCapabilities interface: new InputDeviceCapabilities must inherit property "pointerMovementScrolls" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "pointerMovementScrolls" not found in prototype chain
[PASS] UIEvent interface: attribute sourceCapabilities
Harness: the test ran to completion.
