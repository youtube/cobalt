No-op file. Edit this to kick recipes.

This is a beginning of a story in this silly file.
Once upon a time, a budding web browser dev team needed a CI system.
All they had was one poor machine under a desk, and its name was Batty,
the Build and Test Yeti.

As the CI needs of the browser grew, Batty, the Build and Test Yeti, got
a new friend, but this information was marked RVG, so it was months before
any details were revealed.

The End!
