# OWNERS review for adding / removing UseCounters already happens as part of
# reviewing the actual implementation changes (which is often, but not always
# in blink/renderer/core). No additional review (including IPC security review)
# is required for adding/removing entries from this mapping (consistent with
# metrics/histograms/enums.xml).
