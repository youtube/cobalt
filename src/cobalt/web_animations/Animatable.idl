// TODO: We would like to be able to pass Element and PseudoElements around as
//       Animatable objects, but we don't currently have support in our parsing
//       system to support multiple inheritance between IDL files in order to
//       support this.  This IDL file exists currently as a placeholder for now,
//       as the object is created and destroyed purely within C++ currently.
