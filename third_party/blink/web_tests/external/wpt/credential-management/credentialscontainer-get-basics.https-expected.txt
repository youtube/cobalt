This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] navigator.credentials.get() rejects when aborted after the promise creation
  promise_rejects_exactly: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "NotSupportedError: The user agent does not support public key credentials." but we expected it to throw object "Error: custom error"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
