- //build/rust/rs_bindings_from_cc.gni (support for using Crubit for generating
  C++/Rust bindings during Chromium build using `bin/rs_bindings_from_cc` tool
  + for building such generated files against
  `./src/rs_bindings_from_cc/support` libraries).

- //tools/rust/build_crubit.py (for building `bin/rs_bindings_from_cc` tool for
  packaging and distribution via `gclient sync`)

Local Modifications:
- Added BUILD.gn that covers `src/rs_bindings_from_cc/support'
