Description:
This library implements the Text Fragments draft spec[1] in JavaScript. This
spec accepts URLs with fragments indicating text to be highlighted and scrolled
into view once the page has been loaded.
(e.g.: foo.com/bar#:~:text=example%20highlighted%20text)

This functionality is implemented in Blink on Android and Desktop; on iOS, we
instead rely on injecting this JavaScript implementation. The library is
maintained by Chromium committers & DevRel; it ships on GitHub because it is
shared with an extension and a polyfill.
