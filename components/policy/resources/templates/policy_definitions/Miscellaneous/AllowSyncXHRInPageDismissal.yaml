  This policy allows an admin to specify that a page may send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

        When the policy is set to enabled, pages are allowed to send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

        When the policy is set to disabled or not set, pages are not allowed to send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

        This policy was removed in Chrome 99.
