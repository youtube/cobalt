caption: Block access to sensors on these sites
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets you set a list of URL patterns that specify the sites that can't access sensors like motion and light sensors.

        Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="DEFAULT_SENSORS_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultSensorsSetting</ph> applies for all sites, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

        If the same URL pattern exists in both this policy and the <ph name="SENSORS_ALLOWED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">SensorsAllowedForUrls</ph> policy, this policy is prioritized and access to motion or light sensors will be blocked.

        For detailed information on valid <ph name="URL_LABEL">url</ph> patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph> is not an accepted value for this policy.
