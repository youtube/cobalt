caption: Enable the accessibility virtual keyboard
default: null
desc: |-
  Enable the virtual keyboard accessibility feature.

            If this policy is set to true, the accessibility virtual keyboard will always be enabled.

            If this policy is set to false, the accessibility virtual keyboard will always be disabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, the accessibility virtual keyboard is disabled initially but can be enabled by the user at any time by using the accessibility settings.

            This policy does not affect whether the touch virtual keyboard is enabled. For example, the touch virtual keyboard will still show up on a tablet device even if this policy is set to false. Use the <ph name="TOUCH_VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">TouchVirtualKeyboardEnabled</ph> policy to control the behavior of the touch virtual keyboard.
