This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Property animation-timing-function value 'cubic-bezier(calc(-2), calc(0.7 / 2), calc(1.5), calc(0))'
  assert_true: 'cubic-bezier(calc(-2), calc(0.7 / 2), calc(1.5), calc(0))' is a supported value for animation-timing-function. expected true got false
[FAIL] Property animation-timing-function value 'steps(calc(1), jump-none)'
  assert_true: 'steps(calc(1), jump-none)' is a supported value for animation-timing-function. expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
