Description:
Javascript bindings connecting the Chrome Desktop TTS engine component
extension with a WASM TTS engine.  It passes text to be spoken, and voice
information to the TTS engine, and receives synthesized audio.

The extension does the download of new languages, unzips them into memory, and
passes the information to the wasm module via the bindings.  It also receives
the speech requests, passes them in to the wasm module, and gets audio back,
then sends that to an audio channel.

The Eigen dependency below is used by the WASM TTS Engine's audio syntheis
libraries.

This extension is hosted at
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/wasm-tts-engine, which is a mirror
of a compiled blob file in Google3.
