This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS import() should not drain the microtask queue if it fails during specifier resolution
FAIL import() should not drain the microtask queue when loading an already loaded module assert_less_than: expected a number less than 1000 but got 1000
PASS import() should drain the microtask queue when fetching a new module
