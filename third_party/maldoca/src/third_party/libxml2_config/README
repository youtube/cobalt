config.h contains libxml2's compilation configuration for Linux. It was generated by executing "./configure --with-lzma=no" in the libxml2's main directory.
xmlversion.h was generated by executing "cscript configure.js compiler=msvc prefix=c:\libxml ftp=no http=no html=no iconv=no xml_debug=no" in libxml2's "win32" directory.  
However, it can also be generated by the aforementioned Linux configure command.

Apparently this is needed for windows too and to make that work we manually edited out the linux specific requirements like pthread using #ifdef.
