"""Verifies backward-compatibility of mojom type changes.

Given a set of pre- and post-diff mojom file contents, and a root directory
for a project, this tool verifies that any changes to [Stable] mojom types are
backward-compatible with the previous version.

This can be used e.g. by a presubmit check to prevent developers from making
breaking changes to stable mojoms."""
