  // In particular this creates ChromeMain instances which initialises many
  // low-level objects (such as PostTask, ChromeBrowserStateManager, named

  // the InitStage is below this stage is unsupported. Most likely, you want
  // all new stages to be >= InitStageBrowserObjectsForBackgroundHandlers.

  // on this because the policies might have an effect on later init stages.

  // browser state).
  InitStageBrowserObjectsForUI,
  // If there are connected scenes, the app is creating browsers and starting
  // the root coordinators. The BVCs and Tab switchers are created here. This
  // is what is considered the normal UI.
  //
  // The stage is no-op for regular startups (no FRE, no Safe Mode) in which
  // case the app will continue its transition to InitStageFinal and the UI is
  // initialized when the scene transitions to the foreground.
  InitStageNormalUI,
  // TODO(crbug.com/1198246): Decouple FRE from Browser views to be able to go
  // through this stage before InitStageNormalUI.
  // The app is considering presenting the FRE UI. Will remain in that state
  // when presenting the FRE.
  InitStageFirstRun,
  // The final stage before being done with initialization. The label and
  // relative position (always last) of this enum item should not change.
  // The value may change when inserting enum items between Start and Final.
