This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] e.style['color'] = "hsl(30 -50% 60)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "rgb(153, 153, 153)" but got "rgb(102, 153, 204)"
[FAIL] e.style['color'] = "hsl(0 -50 40%)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "rgb(102, 102, 102)" but got "rgb(51, 153, 153)"
[FAIL] e.style['color'] = "hsl(30 -50 60)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "rgb(153, 153, 153)" but got "rgb(102, 153, 204)"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
