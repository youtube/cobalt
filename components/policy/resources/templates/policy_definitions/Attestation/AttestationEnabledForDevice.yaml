caption: Enable remote attestation for the device
default: false
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled allows remote attestation for the device. A certificate is automatically generated and uploaded to the Device Management Server.

  Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means no certificate is generated and calls to the <ph name="ENTERPRISE_PLATFORM_KEYS_API">Enterprise Platform Keys API</ph> fail.
