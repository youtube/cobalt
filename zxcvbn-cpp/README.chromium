Description:
A realistic password strength estimator. https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/
Used in the Password Manager to inform users about weak passwords.

Local Modifications:

Applied the following patches:
- patches/compilation.diff: To fix compilation under clang with -Werror and
  -DUNICODE.
- patches/adjacency_graphs.diff: Removes static initializers in
  adjacency_graphs.hpp and adjacency_graphs.cpp and greatly reduces binary size
  impact by replacing optional std::strings with base::StringPiece.
- patches/no_static_initializers.diff: Removes static initializers elsewhere by
  either inlining the expression, or making use of static base::NoDestructors.
- patches/dictionary_component.diff: Adds a ParseRankedDictionary API to
  frequency_lists.hpp to support providing the dictionaries via component
  updater and adds an option to build_frequency_lists.py to output the processed
  text files. Furthermore, removes the need to auto generate
  _frequency_lists.hpp and _frequency_lists.cpp
- patches/base_utf8.diff: Replaced string utilities from utils.cpp with //base's
  UTF8 API.
- patches/fix_overflow.diff: Fixes a bug inside scoring.cpp triggered when the
  number of computed guesses exceeds DBL_MAX.
- patches/flat_map_ranked.diff: Use base::flat_map instead of std::unordered_map
  for ranked dictionaries to reduce memory foot print.
- patches/utf8_support.diff: Switched the regex engine in matching.cpp from
  std::regex to ICU's regex, so that repeat matches work with multi-byte code
  points. Also guarded an assert in scoring.cpp that was hit for non-ASCII
  passwords.
- Dropped the data dictionary from the check-out, as the data will now be
  provided via component updater. The used dictionaries can be found at
  https://github.com/rianhunter/zxcvbn-cpp/tree/cf092c952cd2325ce390b2691231a8f1cb195d59/data
- Removed the demo/ folder and zxcvbnn_post.js from the checkout. They only
  contained JavaScript that is irrevelant for the intended usage in Chromium.
- Removed Python sources, unneeded config files, JavaScript bindings, C wrapper
  and incomplete C++ entrypoints from native-src, since they are unused / not
  necessary for Chromium, includes applying patches/no-c-api.diff.
- patches/reduce_memory_usage.diff: Reduce browser memory usage by ~2.0 MiB on
  64bit, ~0.65 MiB on 32bit (https://crrev.com/c/2842124).
- patches/memory_mapping.diff: Adds a wrapper around the binary blob that
  the contents of RankedDicts to allow reading it either directory from memory
  or from a memory mapped file.
- patches/include_utility.diff: Explicitly include <utility> in optional.hpp to
  remove an implicit transitive include dependency in libc++ that will no longer
  exist once Chrome is built with -fmodules.
- patches/no_wstring_convert.diff: Replace usages of std::wstring_convert with
  //base equivalents as the former is deprecated in C++17.

Ran the following commands to generate adjacency graphs:
$ python ./data-scripts/build_keyboard_adjacency_graphs.py ./native-src/zxcvbn/adjacency_graphs.hpp
$ python ./data-scripts/build_keyboard_adjacency_graphs.py ./native-src/zxcvbn/adjacency_graphs.cpp

Ported test/test-matching.coffee and test/test-scoring.coffee to C++ unitests
(test/matching_unittest.cc and test/scoring_unittest.cc).

Added fuzzers for matching and scoring (test/matching_fuzzer.cc and
test/scoring_fuzzer.cc).
