caption: Enable deleting undecryptable passwords
desc: |-
  This policy controls whether the built-in password manager can delete undecryptable passwords from its database. This is required to restore the full functionality of the built-in password manager, but it may include a permanent data loss. Undecryptable password values will not become decryptable on their own and, if fixing them is possible, it usually requires complex user actions.

  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means that users with undecryptable passwords saved to the built-in password manager will lose them. Passwords that are still in a working state will remain untouched.

  Setting the policy to Disabled means users will leave their password manager data untouched, but will experience a broken password manager functionality.

  If the policy is set, users can't change it in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.
