// is fully created. Incidents originating from profiles that do not participate
// in safe browsing extended reporting are dropped. Process-wide incidents are
// affiliated with a profile that participates in safe browsing extended
// reporting when one becomes available.
// Following the addition of an incident that is not dropped, the service
// collects environmental data, finds the most recent binary download, and waits
// a bit. Additional incidents that arrive during this time are collated with
// the initial incident. Finally, already-reported incidents are pruned and any
// remaining are uploaded in an incident report.
