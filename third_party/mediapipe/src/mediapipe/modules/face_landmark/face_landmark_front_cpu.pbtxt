# MediaPipe graph to detect/predict face landmarks. (CPU input, and inference is
# executed on CPU.) This graph tries to skip face detection as much as possible
# by using previously detected/predicted landmarks for new images.
#
# It is required that "face_detection_short_range.tflite" is available at
# "mediapipe/modules/face_detection/face_detection_short_range.tflite"
# path during execution.
#
# It is required that "face_landmark.tflite" is available at
# "mediapipe/modules/face_landmark/face_landmark.tflite"
# path during execution if `with_attention` is not set or set to `false`.
#
# It is required that "face_landmark_with_attention.tflite" is available at
# "mediapipe/modules/face_landmark/face_landmark_with_attention.tflite"
# path during execution if `with_attention` is set to `true`.
