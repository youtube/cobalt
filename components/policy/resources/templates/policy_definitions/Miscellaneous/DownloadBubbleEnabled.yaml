caption: Enable download bubble UI
default: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset shows the new download bubble UI in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> keeps showing the old download shelf UI.

        Note that this policy is temporary and will be removed as soon as the new download bubble UI is fully launched.
