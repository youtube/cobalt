            This feature is responsible for highlighting the object that is focused by the keyboard.

            If this policy is set to enabled, the keyboard focus highlighting will always be enabled.

            If this policy is set to disabled, the keyboard focus highlighting will always be disabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, the keyboard focus highlighting is disabled initially but can be enabled by the user anytime.
