<!--
A page that fetches only "prefetch.js" when scanned by NoStatePrefetch, and
fetches "prefetch_meta.js" in addition to that if javascript execution happens
on the page. In all cases the scripts are executed in a blocking manner.

By prefetching this page, a browsertest can verify that javascript was not
executed (prefetch_meta.js should not be requested to load even after the page
has been fully prefetched (or loaded)).

Note: there is no way to ensure that the script loaded via .appendChild() or a
sync XHR happens before a preload-scannable request because preload scanner is
racy and often fetches resources it sees before the inline script has a chance
to execute.

    var s = document.createElement("script");

    document.body.appendChild(s);

  <!-- Ordering is imporant here because the test harness relies on sequential
    parsing of this page. When a fetch request for prefetch.js happens, it can
    be safely assumed that the browser has parsed the inline script above.  -->

  Some content that is necessary for registering paint metrics.
