This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Test touchpointer capture in same-origin frame: Pointer down at inner frame and set pointer capture to outer frame should not capture.
  assert_array_equals: Received events: innerFrame received pointerdown,innerFrame received gotpointercapture,innerFrame received pointermove,innerFrame received pointerup,innerFrame received lostpointercapture lengths differ, expected array ["innerFrame received pointerdown", "innerFrame received pointermove", "innerFrame received pointerup"] length 3, got ["innerFrame received pointerdown", "innerFrame received gotpointercapture", "innerFrame received pointermove", "innerFrame received pointerup", "innerFrame received lostpointercapture"] length 5
[FAIL] Test touchpointer capture in same-origin frame: Pointer down at outer frame body and set pointer capture in inner frame should not capture.
  assert_array_equals: Received events: outerFrame received pointerdown,outerFrame received gotpointercapture,outerFrame received pointermove,outerFrame received pointerup,outerFrame received lostpointercapture lengths differ, expected array ["outerFrame received pointerdown", "outerFrame received pointermove", "outerFrame received pointerup"] length 3, got ["outerFrame received pointerdown", "outerFrame received gotpointercapture", "outerFrame received pointermove", "outerFrame received pointerup", "outerFrame received lostpointercapture"] length 5
Harness: the test ran to completion.
