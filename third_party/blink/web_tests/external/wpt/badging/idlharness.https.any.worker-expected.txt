This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] WorkerNavigator interface: operation setAppBadge(optional unsigned long long)
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "setAppBadge" missing
[FAIL] WorkerNavigator interface: operation clearAppBadge()
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "clearAppBadge" missing
[FAIL] WorkerNavigator interface: navigator must inherit property "setAppBadge(optional unsigned long long)" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "setAppBadge" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] WorkerNavigator interface: calling setAppBadge(optional unsigned long long) on navigator with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_inherits: property "setAppBadge" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] WorkerNavigator interface: navigator must inherit property "clearAppBadge()" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "clearAppBadge" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
