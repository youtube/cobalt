Python 3 Sprint Outcomes
========================

We provided WebOb with 100% statement coverage at the 2011 PyCon Pyramid
sprint in Atlanta GA.

Participated:

Alexandre Conrad, Patricio Paez, Whit Morriss, Rob Miller, Reed O'Brien,
Chris Shenton, Joe Dallago, Tres Seaver, Casey Duncan, Kai Groner, Chris
McDonough.

In doing so, we added roughly 700-800 unit tests, and disused existing
doctests as coverage (they are still runnable, but don't get run during
``setup.py test``).

We never did get around to actually doing any porting to Python 3.  Adding
comprehensive test coverage proved to be enough work to fill the sprint days.

The bitbucket fork on which this work was done is at
https://bitbucket.org/chrism/webob-py3k.  I've made a tag in that repository
named "sprint-coverage" which represents a reasonable place to pull from for
integration into mainline.

Testing Normally
----------------

 $ python2.x setup.py test

Testing Coverage
----------------

 $ python2.X setup.py nosetests --with-coverage

Testing Documentation
---------------------

Doctests don't run when you run "setup.py test" anymore.  To run them
manually, do:

  $ cd webob
  $ $MYVENV/bin/python setup.py develop
  $ cd docs
  $ $MYVENV/bin/python doctests.py
