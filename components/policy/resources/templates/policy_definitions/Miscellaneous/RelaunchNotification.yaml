desc: |-
  Notify users that <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> must be relaunched or <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> must be restarted to apply a pending update.

        This policy setting enables notifications to inform the user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required. If not set, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> indicates to the user that a relaunch is needed via subtle changes to its menu, while <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> indicates such via a notification in the system tray. If set to 'Recommended', a recurring warning will be shown to the user that a relaunch is recommended. The user can dismiss this warning to defer the relaunch. If set to 'Required', a recurring warning will be shown to the user indicating that a browser relaunch will be forced once the notification period passes. The default period is seven days for <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> and four days for <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>, and may be configured via the <ph name="RELAUNCH_NOTIFICATION_PERIOD_POLICY_NAME">RelaunchNotificationPeriod</ph> policy setting.

        The user's session is restored following the relaunch/restart.
