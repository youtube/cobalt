This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] WebTransport client should be able to create and handle a bidirectional stream
[FAIL] WebTransport client should be able to create and handle a bidirectional stream without waiting for ready
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NetworkError: Failed to execute 'createBidirectionalStream' on 'WebTransport': No connection."
[PASS] WebTransport server should be able to accept and handle a bidirectional stream
[PASS] WebTransport client should be able to create, accept, and handle a unidirectional stream
[FAIL] WebTransport client should be able to create, accept, and handle a unidirectional stream without waiting for ready
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NetworkError: Failed to execute 'createUnidirectionalStream' on 'WebTransport': No connection."
[PASS] Can read data from a bidirectional stream with BYOB reader
[PASS] Can read data from a unidirectional stream with BYOB reader
[PASS] Transfer large chunks of data on a bidirectional stream
[PASS] Transfer large chunks of data on a unidirectional stream
[PASS] Closing the stream with no data still resolves the read request
Harness: the test ran to completion.
