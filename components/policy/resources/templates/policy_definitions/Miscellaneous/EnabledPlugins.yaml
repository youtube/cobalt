caption: Specify a list of enabled plugins
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy is deprecated. Please use the <ph name="DEFAULT_PLUGINS_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultPluginsSetting</ph> to control the availability of the Flash plugin and <ph name="ALWAYS_OPEN_PDF_EXTERNALLY_POLICY_NAME">AlwaysOpenPdfExternally</ph> to control whether the integrated PDF viewer should be used for opening PDF files.

        Specifies a list of plugins that are enabled in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> and prevents users from changing this setting.

        The wildcard characters '*' and '?' can be used to match sequences of arbitrary characters. '*' matches an arbitrary number of characters while '?' specifies an optional single character, i.e. matches zero or one characters. The escape character is '\', so to match actual '*', '?', or '\' characters, you can put a '\' in front of them.

        The specified list of plugins is always used in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> if they are installed. The plugins are marked as enabled in 'about:plugins' and users cannot disable them.

        Note that this policy overrides both DisabledPlugins and DisabledPluginsExceptions.

        If this policy is left not set the user can disable any plugin installed on the system.
