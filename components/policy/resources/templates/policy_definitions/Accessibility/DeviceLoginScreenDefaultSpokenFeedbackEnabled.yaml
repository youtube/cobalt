caption: Set the default state of spoken feedback on the login screen
default: null
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to True turns spoken feedback on at the sign-in screen. Setting the policy to False turns spoken feedback off at the screen.

        If you set the policy, users can temporarily turn spoken feedback on or off. When the sign-in screen reloads or stays idle for a minute, it reverts to its original state.

        If not set, spoken feedback is off at the sign-in screen. Users can turn it on any time, and its status on the sign-in screen persists across users.

            Note: <ph name="DEVICE_LOGIN_SCREEN_SPOKEN_FEEDBACK_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeviceLoginScreenSpokenFeedbackEnabled</ph> overrides this policy if the former is specified.
