Contains ash resources for ambient mode. The main resources currently are Lottie
animation files and their respective image assets for ash's animated
screensaver. These resources reside in an internal CIPD package and are
fetched via gclient only in chromium checkouts with chromeos/internal settings.

The cipd.yaml file is not actually used at build time, but it is a checked in as
a reference for when CIPD needs to be updated with new ambient resources.

UX delivers new versions of the ambient mode resources to eng via
go/chromeos-ambient-deliverables. After a delivery is made, eng must upload them
to CIPD and integrate them into the build system as described above.
