caption: Enable additional protections for users enrolled in the Advanced Protection
  program
default: true
desc: This policy controls whether users enrolled in the Advanced Protection program
  receive extra protections. Some of these features may involve the sharing of data
  with Google (for example, Advanced Protection users will be able to send their downloads
  to Google for malware scanning). If set to True or not set, enrolled users will
  receive extra protections. If set to False, Advanced Protection users will receive
  only the standard consumer features.
