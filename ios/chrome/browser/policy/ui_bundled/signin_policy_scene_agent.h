// A scene agent that monitors the state of the app and policy updates to show
// the sign-out and sign-in prompts. Will show prompts when determined to be
// needed the UI of the scene is available (i.e., the states of the app and
// the scene allow it).
//
// The UI is considered as available when the following conditions are met:
// (1) the profile initialization is over (the stage ProfileInitStage::kFinal is
// reached), (2) the scene is in the foreground, (3) there is no UI blocker, and
// (4) the app isn't shutting down.
//
// There are 4 events that can trigger the prompt: (1) a policy update, (2)
// reaching the ProfileInitStage::kFinal init stage, (3) the scene becomes
// active in the foreground, and (4) the UI blocker is removed.
//
// In a multi-window context, only one scene will present the prompt. The first
// scene to receive the event that triggers the prompt will be the one selected.
// Another scene will be selected if the presenting scene is dismissed.
