This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] dequantizeLinear uint8 1D constant tensor with implicit block_size = 2.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "UnknownError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': DirectML: DequantizeLinear and quantizeLinear can't support block-wise when FL < 6.3."
