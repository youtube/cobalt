This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS setSinkId on default audio output should always work
PASS setSinkId fails with NotFoundError on made up deviceid
FAIL setSinkId() with output device IDs exposed by getUserMedia() should either reject with NotAllowedError or resolve assert_true: audiooutput device groupId must match an exposed microphone expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
