Speech Dispatcher project provides a high-level device independent layer for

interface.

Only the libspeechd.h file is imported, as the client library (libspeechd.so.2)
is dynamically loaded (where present).

This header is imported because later versions of Speech Dispatcher (>= 0.8)
install it into a different location (${includedir}/speech-dispatcher instead
of ${includedir}) and we still need to support older versions.
