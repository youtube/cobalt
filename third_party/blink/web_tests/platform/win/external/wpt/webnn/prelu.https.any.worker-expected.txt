This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] prelu float32 1D tensors / sync
[FAIL] prelu float32 2D tensors / sync
  Failed to execute 'buildSync' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension.
[FAIL] prelu float32 3D tensors / sync
  Failed to execute 'buildSync' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension.
[FAIL] prelu float32 4D tensors / sync
  Failed to execute 'buildSync' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension.
[FAIL] prelu float32 5D tensors / sync
  Failed to execute 'buildSync' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension.
[PASS] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 1D slope / sync
[FAIL] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 1D slope of shape [1] / sync
  Failed to execute 'buildSync' on 'MLGraphBuilder': The input and slope should have the same last dimension.
[FAIL] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 2D slope / sync
  Failed to execute 'buildSync' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension.
