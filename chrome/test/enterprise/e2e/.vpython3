# This file defines all the extra packages we need to install to run the python

# which to run our ./test.py script.

# You can also use this locally by invoking `vpython3` instead of `python3` when

# The default set of platforms vpython checks for does not yet include mac-arm64.
# Setting `verify_pep425_tag` to the list of platforms we explicitly must support
# allows us to ensure that vpython specs stay mac-arm64-friendly
