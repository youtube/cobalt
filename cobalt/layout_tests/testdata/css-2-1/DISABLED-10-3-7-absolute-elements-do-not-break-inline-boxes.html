 | Absolutely positioned elements should not participate in layout though their
 | static position will be set as if they were laid out.  This test checks
 | that an absolute element that ordinarily would have caused a line break
 | within an inline box does not affect layout, and also that the absolute
 | element *does* appear to follow a line break.
