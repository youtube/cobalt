caption: Control access to private network in the Direct Sockets API
default: null
desc: |-
  The Direct Sockets API allows communication with arbitrary endpoints using TCP and UDP.
  Please see https://github.com/WICG/direct-sockets for details.

  Private network endpoints are those using IP addresses from private IP address space, which is defined in https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/#ip-address-space-private.

  Setting the policy to 1 or leaving it unset allows Isolated Web App origins to communicate with private network endpoints in the Direct Sockets API.

  Setting the policy to 2 blocks Isolated Web App origins from communicating with private network endpoints in the Direct Sockets API.

  Note that this policy only applies if the origin is allowed to use the Direct Sockets API.
  Please consult <ph name="DEFAULT_DIRECT_SOCKETS_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultDirectSocketsSetting</ph>, <ph name="DIRECT_SOCKETS_ALLOWED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">DirectSocketsAllowedForUrls</ph> and <ph name="DIRECT_SOCKETS_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">DirectSocketsBlockedForUrls</ph> for more details.
  The default can also be overridden for matching URLs using <ph name="DIRECT_SOCKETS_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ACCESS_ALLOWED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">DirectSocketsPrivateNetworkAccessAllowedForUrls</ph> and <ph name="DIRECT_SOCKETS_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ACCESS_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">DirectSocketsPrivateNetworkAccessBlockedForUrls</ph>

  This policy applies only to new connection attempts and doesn't invalidate existing connections.
