# usage: dirdiffer.sh old_dir new_dir patch_dir
#
# dirdiffer creates a patch directory patch_dir that represents the difference
# between old_dir and new_dir. patch_dir can be used with dirpatcher to
# recreate new_dir given old_dir.
#
# dirdiffer operates recursively, properly handling ordinary files, symbolic
# links, and directories, as they are found in new_dir. Symbolic links and
# directories are always replicated as-is in patch_dir. Ordinary files will
# be represented at the appropriate location in patch_dir by one of the
# following:
#
#  - a binary diff prepared by goobsdiff that can transform the file at the
#    same position in old_dir to the version in new_dir, but only when such a
#    file already exists in old_dir and is an ordinary file. These files are
#    given a "$gbs" suffix.
#  - a bzip2-compressed copy of the new file from new_dir; in patch_dir, the
#    new file will have a "$bz2" suffix.
#  - a gzip-compressed copy of the new file from new_dir; in patch_dir, the
#    new file will have a "$gz" suffix.
#  - an xz/lzma2-compressed copy of the new file from new_dir; in patch_dir,
#    the new file will have an "$xz" suffix.
#  - an uncompressed copy of the new file from new_dir; in patch_dir, the
#    new file will have a "$raw" suffix.
#
# The unconventional suffixes are used because they aren't likely to occur in
# filenames.
#
# Of these options, the smallest possible representation is chosen. Note that
# goobsdiff itself will also compress various sections of a binary diff with
# bzip2, gzip, or xz/lzma2, or leave them uncompressed, according to which is
# smallest. The approach of choosing the smallest possible representation is
# time-consuming but given the choices of compressors results in an overall
# size reduction of about 3%-5% relative to using bzip2 as the only
# compressor; bzip2 is generally more effective for these data sets than gzip,
# and xz/lzma2 more effective than bzip2.
#
# For large input files, goobsdiff is also very time-consuming and
# memory-intensive. The overall "wall clock time" spent preparing a patch_dir
# representing the differences between Google Chrome's 6.0.422.0 and 6.0.427.0
# versioned directories from successive weekly dev channel releases on a
# 2.53GHz dual-core 4GB MacBook Pro is 3 minutes. Reconstructing new_dir with
# dirpatcher is much quicker; in the above configuration, only 10 seconds are
# needed for reconstruction.
#
# After creating a full patch_dir structure, but before returning, dirpatcher
# is invoked to attempt to recreate new_dir in a temporary location given
# old_dir and patch_dir. The recreated new_dir is then compared against the
# original new_dir as a verification step. Should verification fail, dirdiffer
# exits with a nonzero status, and patch_dir should not be used.
#
# Environment variables:
# DIRDIFFER_EXCLUDE
#   When an entry in new_dir matches this regular expression, it will not be
#   included in patch_dir. All prospective paths in new_dir will be matched
#   against this regular expression, including directories. If a directory
#   matches this pattern, dirdiffer will also ignore the directory's contents.
# DIRDIFFER_NO_DIFF
#   When an entry in new_dir matches this regular expression, it will not be
#   represented in patch_dir by a $gbs file prepared by goobsdiff. It will only
#   appear as a $bz2, $gz, or $raw file. Only files in new_dir, not
#   directories,  will be matched against this regular expression.
#
# Exit codes:
#  0  OK
#  1  Unknown failure
#  2  Incorrect number of parameters
#  3  Input directories do not exist or are not directories
#  4  Output directory already exists
#  5  Parent of output directory does not exist or is not a directory
#  6  An input or output directories contains another
#  7  Could not create output directory
#  8  File already exists in output directory
#  9  Found an irregular file (non-directory, file, or symbolic link) in input
# 10  Could not create symbolic link
# 11  File copy failed
# 12  bzip2 compression failed
# 13  gzip compression failed
# 14  xz/lzma2 compression failed
# 15  Patch creation failed
# 16  Verification failed
# 17  Could not set mode (permissions)
# 18  Could not set modification time
# 19  Invalid regular expression (irregular expression?)
