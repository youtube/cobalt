/**
 * @summary Floating action buttons (FABs) help people take primary actions.
 * They’re used to represent the most important action on a screen, such as
 * Create or Reply.
 *
 * @description
 * __Emphasis:__ High emphasis – For the primary, most important, or most common
 * action on a screen
 *
 * __Rationale:__ The FAB remains the default component for a screen’s primary
 * action. It comes in three sizes: small FAB, FAB, and large FAB. The extended
 * FAB’s wider format and text label give it more visual prominence than a  FAB.
 * It’s often used on larger screens where a FAB would seem too small. Branded
 * FABs are used to specifically call attention to branded logo icons.
 *
 * __Example usages:__
 * - FAB
 *   - Create
 *   - Compose
 * - Extended FAB
 *   - Create
 *   - Compose
 *   - New Thread
 *   - New File
 *
 * @final
 * @suppress {visibility}
