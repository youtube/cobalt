  <owner>arichiv@google.com</owner>
  <owner>src/net/cookies/OWNERS</owner>
  <summary>
    Emits when a cookie restore is attempted by Android Incognito Mode session
    restoration. This happens if an in-progress incognito session is killed by
    the system (e.g., memory pressure) and not by the user.

    The enum value is true when the cookie was restored properly and false if it
    was rejected. Rejection should be rare as the cookies are directly written
    out by the system.
