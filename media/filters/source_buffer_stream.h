// SourceBufferStream is a data structure that stores media Buffers in ranges.
// Buffers can be appended out of presentation order. Buffers are retrieved by
// seeking to the desired start point and calling GetNextBuffer(). Buffers are
// returned in sequential order to feed decoder, generally near presentation
// order though not necessarily the same as presentation order within GOPs of
// out-of-order codecs.
