git-mark-merge-base(1)
======================

NAME
----
git-mark-merge-base -
include::_git-mark-merge-base_desc.helper.txt[]

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git mark-merge-base'
'git mark-merge-base' <commit hash>
'git mark-merge-base' [-d | --delete]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Inspect, set or delete the current merge-base marker for the current branch.
This should not be needed, but is useful if things get into a snarled state.
Pass no arguments to view the current value. If you provide <commit hash>, then
`git mark-merge-base` will attempt to set that as the merge-base value.

It is invalid to pick a commit which is not an ancestor of the current branch.

See linkgit:git-rebase-update[1]'s description of the `branch.<name>.base`
configuration variable for more info on what the merge base markers are for.

OPTIONS
-------

-d::
--delete::
  Delete the merge-base marker for the current branch.

<commit hash>::
  The new value to set for the current branch's merge-base marker.
