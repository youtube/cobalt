caption: Allow JavaScript optimization on these sites
desc: |-
  Allows you to set a list of site url patterns that specify sites for which
  advanced JavaScript optimizations are enabled.

  For detailed information on valid site url patterns, please see
  https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.
  Wildcards, <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph>, are allowed.

  JavaScript optimization policy exceptions will only be enforced at a site
  granularity (eTLD+1). A policy set for only subdomain.site.com will not
  correctly apply to site.com or subdomain.site.com since they both resolve to
  the same eTLD+1 (site.com) for which there is no policy. In this case, policy
  must be set on site.com to apply correctly for both site.com and
  subdomain.site.com.

  This policy applies on a frame-by-frame basis and not based on top level
  origin url alone, so e.g. if site-one.com is listed in the <ph
  name="JAVA_SCRIPT_OPTIMIZER_ALLOWED_FOR_SITES_POLICY_NAME">
  JavaScriptOptimizerAllowedForSites</ph> policy but site-one.com loads a frame   containing site-two.com then site-one.com will have JavaScript optimizations
  enabled, but site-two.com will use the policy from <ph
  name="DEFAULT_JAVA_SCRIPT_OPTIMIZER_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">
  DefaultJavaScriptOptimizerSetting</ph>, if set, or default to JavaScript
  optimizations enabled. Blocklist entries have higher priority than allowlist
  entries, which in turn have higher priority than the configured default value.

  If this policy is not set for a site then the policy from <ph
  name="DEFAULT_JAVA_SCRIPT_OPTIMIZER_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">
  DefaultJavaScriptOptimizerSetting</ph> applies to the site, if set, otherwise
  Javascript optimization is enabled for the site.
