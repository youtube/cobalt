// result of creating the new mini_views. `new_mini_views` contains a list of

// left of the new mini views in the desks bar, while `mini_views_right` are the
// mini views on the right side of the new mini views.
// The new desk button and the library button (if it exists) will be moved to
// the right. `shift_x` is the amount by which the mini_views (new and existing)
// will be moved horizontally as a result of creating the new mini_views.
//
// * Notes:

//   mini_views (new and existing) have already been laid out in their final
