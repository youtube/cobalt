Description:
After fetching from Google storage, the data/ folder contains a filter list
derived from EasyList. It is used for the Subresource Filter, as described at
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/subresource_filter/README.md.
This copy is included in WebLayer releases, but is not used for Chrome. Instead,
Chrome's filter list is updated via the component updater.

Local Modifications:
The filter list is processed to reduce its size substantially. We include the
unindexed version of this smaller ruleset. The full process is described at
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/subresource_filter/FILTER_LIST_GENERATION.md.
A manifest.json file is added to the top-level directory and is not based on
EasyList. It mirrors the manifest.json file distributed by component updater for
Chrome and lists version information for the derived list.
