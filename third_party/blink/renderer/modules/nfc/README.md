# Web NFC Blink Module

`renderer/modules/nfc` implements the renderer process details and bindings for
the [Web NFC specification]. It communicates with the browser process through the
[Web NFC Mojo interface]. The platform-specific parts of the
implementation are located in `services/device/nfc`.
