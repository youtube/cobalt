caption: Disable third-party storage partitioning for specific top-level origins
desc: |-
  This policy allows you to set a list of URL patterns that specify top-level origins for which third-party storage partitioning (partitioning of cross-origin iframe storage) should be disabled.

  If this policy is left unset or if a top-level origin doesn't match one of the URL patterns, <ph name="DEFAULT_THIRD_PARTY_STORAGE_PARTITIONING_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultThirdPartyStoragePartitioningSetting</ph> will apply.

  For detailed information on valid patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. Note that patterns you list here are treated as origins, not URLs, so you should not specify a path.

  For detailed information on third-party storage partitioning, please see https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/cookies/storage-partitioning.
