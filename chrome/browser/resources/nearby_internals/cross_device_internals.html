<!--
  TODO(b/276319002): The <cross-device-internals> element will eventually
  replace the <nearby-internals> object as main page. However
  cross-device-internals needs to be built out first which is low priority.
  Until it is complete, cross-device-internals will be used as a part of the
  ui-triggers-tab.
