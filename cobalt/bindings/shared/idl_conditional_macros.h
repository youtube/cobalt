// Define preprocessor macros that cannot be determined at GYP time for use in
// IDL files with Conditionals (e.g. conditional interface definitions, or
// conditional attributes). This is necessary to make macros for IDL
// Conditionals that are dependent on Starboard feature macros that get defined
// in header files.

// This is used to conditionally define the On Screen Keyboard interface and
