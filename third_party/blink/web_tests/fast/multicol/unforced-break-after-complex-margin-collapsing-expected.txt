Given a parent block with an empty collapse-through child followed by a child with a top margin, check that the parent block is pulled downwards by that margin, to the exact top of the next column. The collapse-through child prevents us from correctly estimating the logical top of the parent initially.

Below there should be a yellow box. Inside it there should be a top-center aligned green box.
