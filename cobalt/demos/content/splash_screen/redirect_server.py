"""Tests the effect that HTTP redirects have on the Cobalt splash screen.

Run this script from the src directory, i.e.

src$ python cobalt/demos/content/splash_screen/redirect_server.py

Let $(hostname) be the local machine's hostname, and let ${port} be
the port printed out by the python script. Then in a separate tab, run
Cobalt and pass the initial URL

http://"$(hostname)":${port}/cobalt/demos/splash_screen/link_splash_screen.html?redirect=yes

(note the HTTP not HTTPS) which will be redirected to

http://"$(hostname)":${port}/cobalt/demos/splash_screen/redirected.html

The expected behavior is that the splash screen served by
redirected.html (beforeunload.html, a blue page with an animated rectangle in
the top left) will be cached separately from the splash screen served
by link_splash_screen.html (the Cobalt logo splash screen).

Specifically, starting with an empty cache, if we navigate to
http://"$(hostname)":${port}...link_splash_screen.html?redirect=yes ,
a new splash screen should be cached to the cache directory
(beforeunload.html). If we then navigate to
http://"$(hostname)":${port}...link_splash_screen.html (without the
query parameter), we should see no splash screen displayed at first
run, and cobalt_splash_screen.html should be cached to the cache
directory. On a second navigation to
http://"$(hostname)":${port}...link_splash_screen.html (without the
query parameter), we should see the cached Cobalt logo splash screen
displayed.

In short, although redirected.html serves a splash screen it should
not be seen when we redirect there via
link_splash_screen.html?redirect=yes and certainly not when we
navigate to link_splash_screen.html without query parameters. The
splash screen cached by redirected.html should only be seen when we
navigate directly to redirected.html.

It is OK if navigating to link_splash_screen.html first, then shows
the Cobalt logo splash screen on the next navigation to
link_splash_screen.html?redirect=yes.
