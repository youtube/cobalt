  Origins or hostname patterns for which restrictions on
        insecure origins should not apply
deprecated: true
desc: "Deprecated in M69. Use\n      OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin\
  \ instead.\n\n      The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns\
  \ (such as \"*.example.com\") for which security restrictions on insecure origins\
  \ will not apply.\n\n      The intent is to allow organizations to allow origins\
  \ for legacy applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server\
  \ for internal web development so that their developers can test out features requiring\
  \ secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy\
  \ will also prevent the origin from being labeled \"Not Secure\" in the omnibox.\n\
  \n      Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the\
  \ command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a comma-separated\
  \ list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will override the command-line\
  \ flag.\n\n      This policy is deprecated in M69 in favor of OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin.\
  \ If both policies are present, OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin will\
  \ override this policy.\n\n      For more information on secure contexts, see https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/\n\
