Description:
   The Apache Portable Runtime Library provides a predictable and
   consistent interface to underlying platform-specific
   implementations, with an API to which software developers may code
   and be assured of predictable if not identical behavior regardless
   of the platform on which their software is built, relieving them of
   the need to code special-case conditions to work around or take
   advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.

Local Modifications:
1. Ran ./configure
