This directory contains a pre-compiled / fallback copy of the runtime library.
It was necessary for WebAPKs to switch to supporting Android O because as soon
as the app targets Android O a notification channel was necessary for the
notification to be shown. Since the runtime library is provided by the host
browser, there's no way to guarantee this with the WebAPK shell change.

To update this generated copy again:
$ ninja -C out/Debug webapk_runtime_library
$ unzip out/Debug/gen/chrome/android/webapk/libs/runtime_library/webapk_service_aidl.srcjar
$ mv org/chromium/webapk/lib/runtime_library/IWebApkApi.java chrome/android/webapk/shell_apk/src/org/chromium/webapk/lib/runtime_library/
$ git cl format
