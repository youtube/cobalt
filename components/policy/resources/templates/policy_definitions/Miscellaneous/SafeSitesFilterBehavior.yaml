caption: Control SafeSites adult content filtering.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy controls the SafeSites URL filter, which uses the Google Safe Search API to classify URLs as pornographic or not.

        When this policy is set to:

        * Do not filter sites for adult content, or not set, sites aren't filtered

        * Filter top level sites for adult content, pornographic sites are filtered
