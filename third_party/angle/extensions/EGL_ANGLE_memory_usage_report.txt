New Tokens
   Accepted by the <attribute> parameter of eglQueryContext

Additions to the EGL 1.3 Specification

   If <attribute>=EGL_CONTEXT_MEMORY_USAGE_ANGLE is passed to eglQueryContext, then the
   <value> pointer is expected to point to an array of 2 32-bit values. Upon a successful
   return, value[0] and value[1]  will contain the low and high 32-bit parts of a 64-bit
   value. This 64-bit value is the estimated memory usage of all live GL objects belonging
   to the given context's shared group.
