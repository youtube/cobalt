caption: Allow kiosk web app to show network prompt on app launch if the device is offline
default: true
desc: |-
  If the policy is disabled, it represents that the kiosk web app cannot function offline. A network prompt will be shown on a kiosk session start only if the device is offline. This will make sure that the device is online before the app is successfully launched.

  This network prompt might not be shown if an app is set to auto-launch and the <ph name="PROMPT_POLICY_NAME">DeviceLocalAccountPromptForNetworkWhenOffline</ph> (<ph name="PROMPT_POLICY_URL">https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#DeviceLocalAccountPromptForNetworkWhenOffline</ph>) is disabled.

  This policy has no effect on Chrome App or Web app which has a install URL which performs a cross-origin redirect to a different Web app (For eg. if the app install URL is  <ph name="APP_INSTALL_URL">https://example.com</ph>, but, on load it redirects to a different Web App i.e. <ph name="APP_REDIRECTED_URL">https://www.app.example.de</ph>).

  If the policy is set to true or not set, web apps will be launched even if the device is offline.
