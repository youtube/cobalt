Security Critical: yes

Description:
This directory contains build rules and the grpc-java protoc plugin source code.

The gRPC runtime lives in //third_party/android_deps/libs/io_grpc_grpc_*

Please note that the use of gRPC is not generally allowed within Chromium.
Before integrating with this library, consult with the security team.
See go/chrome-grpc-advice for more details.

The only currently allowed use case is for inter-app communication in android
using on-device binder channel transport.

Steps to upgrade:
- Follow the instructions in //third_party/android_deps/README.md to update the
  runtime.
- Download the source code of the same version and copy the files from
  <grpc-java root>/compiler/src/java_plugin/cpp/ to
  //third_party/grpc-java/compiler_plugin/
- You might need to update the compiler plugin's build configuration
  (//third_party/grpc-java/BUILD), for example if files were added or renamed.
- Update this file (README.chromium) with the new metadata (version, revision,
  source url and SHA-512 hash).
