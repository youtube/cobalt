# Enable additional owners for specific json files. This is reserved for people
# that are familiar with how Chromium builders run tests and understand the
# implications of changing these files. Unfortunately, changing specific builder
# bundles requires an owner of the starlark file as well. See
# crbug.com/338426142 for more information and a possible solution.

# Until such time as all of the builders in a builder group are migrated to set
# their tests in starlark, these entries should be kept in sync with
# //testing/buildbot
