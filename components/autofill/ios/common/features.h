// TODO(crbug.com/40281788): Remove once launched.

// content world for the Autofill JS feature scripts.

// for Autofill.

// sticks there until navigating from an explicit user gesture (e.g. reload or
// load a new page from the omnibox). This includes the infobar UI and the

// timeout but will be dismissed once navigating from an explicit user gesture.
