# Follow

This directory contains code and metadata for the Follow feature, which allows
users to follow sites and get updates from them. This directory has frontend and
Chrome-specific parts of the Following feature. Other important directories
include:

* //chrome/browser/feed
* //components/feed

This directory is likely to contain very little code, since the Follow
implementation is largely part of the Feed at the moment.
