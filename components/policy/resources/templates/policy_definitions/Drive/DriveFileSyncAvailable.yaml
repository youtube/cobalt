  <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>ChromeOS</ex></ph> file sync automatically
  makes <ph name="GOOGLE_DRIVE_NAME">Google Drive</ph> files in a user's “My
  Drive” available offline (space permitting) on
  <ph name="CHROMEBOOK_PLUS_NAME">Chromebook Plus</ph> devices.

  Once the feature is on, all new files will also be made available offline
  automatically. If later there is insufficient space, all new files will stop
  being made available offline automatically. However, the user can still
  manually make items available offline.

  Setting the policy to <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_VISIBLE">visible</ph>: Shows
  file sync in the Files app and Settings. The user can turn file sync on or
  off.

  Setting the policy to <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_DISABLEDE">disabled</ph>: Turns
  off file sync if it was previously turned on by the user. Hides the feature
  from the Files app and Settings so the user can’t turn it back on. Existing
  files that were made available offline by the user will remain available
  offline. The user can still manually make items available offline.

  If the policy is unset: <ph name="POLICY_VALUE_VISIBLE">visible</ph> is the
  default selection.
