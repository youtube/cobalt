Description:
GifPlayer allows animated GIFs to be displayed in Android's native view
system.

The GifDrawable library is a partial library built from the GifDecoder of
android-gifview which was originally created by tomorrowkey@gmail.com. We
took the algorithm to add gif animation for android and adapted the algorithm
as a Drawable.

Local Modifications:
* Derived BaseGifDrawable.java and BaseGifImage.java from the original
  GifDecoder.java.
* Removed GifDecoder.java as it is no longer needed (it served only as the
  pristine source file for the two derived files).
* Added license headers to BaseGifDrawable.java and BaseGifImage.java.
