caption: Enable leak detection for entered credentials
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled lets users have <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> check whether usernames and passwords entered were part of a leak.

  Setting the policy to Disabled does not let users have this functionality.

        If the policy is set, users can't change it in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>. If not set, credential leak checking is allowed, but the user can turn it off.
