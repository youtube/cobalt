"Template processing that is more suitable for the specific development-time
and runtime requirements of AJAX based web applications.

Specifically, support the case to update a previous template processing
output with an incremental change to the original input data."

Uncalled functions have been removed from util.js to make the resulting
javascript smaller.

compile.py is a simple program used to generate the single compiled
jsfile.

jstemplate_compiled.js is the output after passing the code through
compile.sh.

Local modifications:
Changed JSDoc annotations and subtle code changes to make it compile with modern
versions of Closure Compiler. TODO(dbeam): upstream to google code project.

Added Trusted Types support to jstemplate.
