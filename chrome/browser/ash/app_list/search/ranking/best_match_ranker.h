// A ranker that inspects the scores of incoming results and picks out some of
// them to become 'best matches' to be moved to the top of the results list.
//
// Best Match candidates are identified by thresholding the scores of incoming
// results. It is assumed that this runs after scores have been transformed to a
// near-uniform distribution per-provider by the ScoreNormalizingRanker, and so
// a score of 0.95 indicates a 95th percentile result from a provider, for
// example. It is also assumed that this runs before the category ranker, which
// moves the scores out of the normalized range [0,1].
//
// In the pre-burn-in period, Best Match candidates are simply ranked by
// normalized relevance score. This is the same in the post-burn-n period, with
// the addition that the highest-ranked kNumBestMatches results are stabilized
// in their positions, and cannot be displaced by later arriving best matches.
