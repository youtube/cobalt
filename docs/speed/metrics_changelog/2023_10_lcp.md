# Largest Contentful Paint bug in Chrome 117

Chromium 117 introduced a bug in LCP, where web applications that trigger 
[soft navigation heuristics](https://github.com/WICG/soft-navigations) may get
spurious LCP entries, if they do not stop listening to LCP entries upon user
interaction. This bug impacted only web-exposed LCP entries, and was not
reflected in CrUX.

The bug was
[reported](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1488273) 
and fixed on the Chromium 118 branch.

## How does this affect a site's metrics?

As a result of this issue, you may see outsized LCP results in your Chromium 117
traffic, which includes Chrome as well as other Chromium-based browsers.
