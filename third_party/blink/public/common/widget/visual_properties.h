// Visual properties contain context required to render a frame tree.
// For legacy reasons, both Page visual properties [shared by all Renderers] and
// Widget visual properties [unique to local frame roots] are passed along the
// same data structure. Separating these is tricky because they both affect
// rendering, and if updates are received asynchronously, this can cause
// incorrect behavior.
// Visual properties are also used for Pepper fullscreen and popups, which are
// also based on Widgets.
//
// The data flow for VisualProperties is tricky. For legacy reasons, visual
// properties are currently always sent from RenderWidgetHosts to RenderWidgets.
// However, RenderWidgets can also send visual properties to out-of-process
// subframes [by bouncing through CrossProcessFrameConnector]. This causes a
// cascading series of VisualProperty messages. This is necessary due to the
// current implementation to make sure that cross-process surfaces get
// simultaneously synchronized. For more details, see:

// Known problems:
// + It's not clear which properties are page-specific and which are
// widget-specific. We should document them.
// + It's not clear which properties are only set by the browser, which are only
// set by the renderer, and which are set by both.
// + Given the frame tree A(B(A')) where A and A' are same-origin, same process
// and B is separate origin separate process:
//   (1) RenderWidget A gets SynchronizeVisualProperties, passes it to proxy for
//   B, sets values on RenderView/Page.
//   (2) RenderWidget B gets SynchronizeVisualProperties, passes it to proxy for
//   A'
//   (3) RenderWidget A' gets SynchronizeVisualProperties.
// In between (1) and (3), frames associated with RenderWidget A' will see
// updated page properties from (1) but are still seeing old widget properties.
