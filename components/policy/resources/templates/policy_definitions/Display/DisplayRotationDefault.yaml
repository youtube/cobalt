caption: Set default display rotation, reapplied on every reboot
default: 0
desc: |-
  Setting the policy has each display rotate to the specified orientation on every reboot and the first time it's connected after the policy value changes. Users may change the display rotation through the settings page after signing in, but it changes back at the next reboot. This policy applies to primary and secondary displays.

  If not set, the default value is 0 degrees and users are free to change it. In this case, the default value isn't reapplied at restart.
