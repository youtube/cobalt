// Navigation Upgrades).
// The tests here use WKWebView and don't go through Chrome's net stack. Due to
// this, we can't serve valid HTTPS over the test server due to platform
// limitations on iOS. Instead, we use a faux-HTTPS server (goodHTTPSServer)
// which is just another HTTP_SERVER but runs on a different port and returns a
// different text than self.testServer. badHTTPSServer is a proper HTTPS_SERVER
// that just serves bad HTTPS responses. slowServer is a server that serves hung
// responses.
