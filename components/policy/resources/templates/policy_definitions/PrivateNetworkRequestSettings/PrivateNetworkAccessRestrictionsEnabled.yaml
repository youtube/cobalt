caption: Specifies whether to apply restrictions to requests to more-private
  network endpoints

desc: |-
  When this policy is set to Enabled, any time when a warning is supposed to be
  displayed in the <ph name="DEV_TOOLS_NAME">DevTools</ph> due to <ph
  name="PRIVATE_NETWORK_ACCESS">Private Network Access</ph> checks failing, the
  main request will be blocked instead.

  When this policy is set to Disabled or unset, all <ph
  name="PRIVATE_NETWORK_ACCESS">Private Network Access</ph> warnings will not
  be enforced and the requests will not be blocked.

  See https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/ for <ph
  name="PRIVATE_NETWORK_ACCESS">Private Network Access</ph> restrictions.
