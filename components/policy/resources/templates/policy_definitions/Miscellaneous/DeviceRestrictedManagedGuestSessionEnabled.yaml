caption: Restricted managed guest sessions
default: false
desc: |-
  The policy only applies to managed guest sessions. It has to be enabled for Imprivata's shared workstation mode to allow in-session user switches.
        Setting the policy to True will forcefully override certain policies for features, which persist sensitive user data and are not handled by the clean-up mechanism used for in-session user switches with Imprivata shared workstation mode.
        Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset will not override any policies.
