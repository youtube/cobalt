  <summary>
    Records the different status codes that are emitted by chrome_elf.dll while
    initializing the NtMapViewOfSection hook used to blocked third-party DLLs.
    Multiple status codes can be emitted per initialization since some of those
    status codes represent non-fatal failures. E.g. Failure to clear the
    previous failure codes. This also means that duplicates are possible. This
    is recorded shortly after Chrome launches, since chrome_elf.dll doesn't have
    access to the //base API. This histogram was expired between M82 and M114.
