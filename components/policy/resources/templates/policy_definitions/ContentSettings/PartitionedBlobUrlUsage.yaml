caption: Choose whether Blob URLs are partitioned during fetching and navigations

default: true

desc: |-
  This policy controls whether Blob URLs are partitioned during fetching and navigation.
  If this policy is set to Enabled or not set, Blob URLs will be partitioned.
  If this policy is set to Disabled, Blob URLs won't be partitioned.

  If storage partitioning is disabled for a given top-level origin by either
  <ph name="THIRD_PARTY_STORAGE_PARTITIONING_BLOCKED_FOR_ORIGINS_POLICY_NAME">ThirdPartyStoragePartitioningBlockedForOrigins</ph>
  or <ph name="DEFAULT_THIRD_PARTY_STORAGE_PARTITIONING_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultThirdPartyStoragePartitioningSetting</ph>,
  then Blob URLs will also not be partitioned.

  If you must use the policy, please file a bug at
  <ph name="BUG_URL">$1<ex>https://crbug.com/new?component=1779870&amp;cc=awillia@chromium.org&amp;priority=p1&amp;type=bug&amp;noWizard=true</ex></ph>
  explaining your use case. The policy is scheduled to be offered through
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 143, after which
  the old implementation will be removed.

  NOTE: Only newly-started renderer processes will reflect changes to this
  policy while the browser is running.
