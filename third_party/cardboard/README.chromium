Description:
The Cardboard SDK supports a simple API used for displaying VR scenes on
smartphones inserted into Cardboard viewers.

Local Modifications:
* Created local top-level BUILD.gn based on src/sdk/build.gradle
* Created local proguard-rules.pro to create more scoped proto-specific rules
* Created local override for LoadJClass in jni_utils to leaverage //base JNI loading due to splits.
* Created local configuration header file with the OpenGL ES 2.0 binding customization required by setting the CARDBOARD_USE_CUSTOM_GL_BINDINGS buildflag.
* Created local override in sdk/sensors/android gyroscope and accelerometer classes, to use
  ALooper_pollOnce instead of ALooper_pollAll. This should be removed once the Cardboard SDK is
  upgraded to version v1.26.0 (b/354725659).
