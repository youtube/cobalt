    Spotted by: Dave Smith <dave thesmithfam.org>

Changes with version 1.0.4

 *) Added support for Python 3.3

 *) Collapsion protection was reduced to "+ +" and "- -" sequences (which
    still includes longer sequences like "+ ++")


Changes with version 1.0.3

 *) "+ ++" and "- --" sequences are no longer collapsed. They were before,
    because the original jsmin collapsed them, too.

 *) Updated benchmarks, added slimit and removed jsmin v8 (because it produced
    invalid results).

 *) Removed "classic" regex variant.


Changes with version 1.0.2

 *) Although it should work, python 2.3 is no longer supported.
    (No suitable test environment)

 *) "return /regex/" is now recognized as regex expression. It wasn't before,
    because the original jsmin ignored that, too.


Changes with version 1.0.1

 *) Add C extension reimplementing the regex from rjsmin.py


Changes with version 1.0.0

 *) First stable release.
