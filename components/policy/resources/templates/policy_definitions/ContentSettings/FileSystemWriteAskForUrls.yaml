caption: Allow write access to files and directories on these sites
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets you list the URL patterns that specify which sites can ask users to grant them write access to files or directories in the host operating system's file system.

        Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="DEFAULT_FILE_SYSTEM_WRITE_GUARD_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultFileSystemWriteGuardSetting</ph> applies for all sites, if it's set. If not, users' personal settings apply.

        URL patterns must not conflict with <ph name="FILE_SYSTEM_WRITE_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">FileSystemWriteBlockedForUrls</ph>. Neither policy takes precedence if a URL matches with both.

        For detailed information on valid <ph name="URL_LABEL">url</ph> patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph> is not an accepted value for this policy.
