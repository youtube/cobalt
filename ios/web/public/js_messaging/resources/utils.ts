/**
 * @fileoverview Utility functions used throughout iOS JavaScript.
 * It is important to note that import statements are merged into a single
 * script during compile time as WebKit doesn't support JS imports across
 * user scripts. This will have the effect of functions here being duplicated.
 * If it is important for your function to keep state, storing that state
 * globally or within a file which is injected only once is necessary. Global
 * state can be saved within __gCrWeb and accessed through functions here.
 * For more complex logic or to avoid global state, bundle a script on its own
 * via the gn `optimize_js` template and include the script as a user script.
 * Such a script can maintain state, for  example see `find_in_page.js`.
 * If access to the state is required outside of the single script file, API
 * can be exposed through `__gCrWeb` in the same way that functions are exposed
 * for calling from the native Objective-C++ code.
