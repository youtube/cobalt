// * De-duplicates recorded samples so that the same
//   〈IdentifiableSurface,IdentifiableToken〉 tuple doesn't get sent to the
//   UkmRecorder more than once per `ukm::SourceId`.
//
// * Caps the number of samples that can be recorded against the same surface
//   per `ukm::SourceId`. Drops samples in excess of
//   kMaxTrackedSamplesPerSurfaces.
//
// * Caps the total number of surfaces that can be tracked for a single process.
//   Drops samples in excess of kMaxTrackedSurfaces.
//
// * Buffers metrics instead of invoking `UkmRecorder::Record` each time
//   a sample arrives.
//
//   * The number of metrics so buffered is capped at kMaxUnsentSamples. If more
//     than this many are to be buffered, then flushes all unsent metrics.
//
//   * The age of metrics so buffered is capped at kMaxUnsentSampleAge. If
//     samples have been sitting in the unsent buffer for longer than that,
//     flushes all unsent metrics.
//
//   * In so buffering, organizes observed metrics into the fewest number of
//     `UkmEntry` instances that are required to record them via `UkmRecorder.
//
// The goal, obviously is to prevent the identifiability study from DoSing the
// browser process and the UKM subsystem since there can be lots of metrics
