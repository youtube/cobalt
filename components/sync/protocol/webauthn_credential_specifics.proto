  // An RP ID is a WebAuthn concept:

  optional string rp_id = 3;

  // The user ID, which is also called a “user handle” in WebAuthn
  // (https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#user-handle), is an RP-specific
  // identifier that is up to 64-bytes long. An authenticator conceptually only
  // stores a single credential for a given (rp_id, user_id) pair, but there
  // may be several credentials in Sync. They are prioritised using
  // newly_shadowed_credential_ids and creation_time. See below.
  //
  // (We wish to be able to retain several entities for a single (rp_id,
  // user_id) pair because there’s an edge case where we may wish to revert to
  // an older entry and thus need to keep the older entry around in Sync. The
  // revert could happen on a different device too.)
  optional bytes user_id = 4;

  // The id of credentials with the same (rp_id, user_id) that were
  // shadowed by the creation of this entity.
  //
  // A credential is shadowed if one or more other credentials (from the same
  // account, and with the same (rp_id, user_id)) include its credential_id in
  // their list of shadowed IDs. Shadowed credentials are ignored when finding
  // a credential to sign with. If there is more than one candidate remaining
  // after filtering shadowed credentials then the most recently created (based
  // on creation_time) is used.
  //
  // The reason for all this is that sites can replace a credential by creating
  // another one with the same (rp_id, user_id) pair. However, we don't
  // immediately know whether the WebAuthn response reached the website's
  // server. Consider a user with a poor internet connection. Javascript in the
  // site's origin triggers a credential creation that “overwrites” an existing
  // credential, but the Javascript is unable to send the new public key to the
  // website's server. The user is now locked out: the old credential has been
  // over-written but the website's server doesn't know about the new one.
  //
  // Thus we wish to keep “overwritten” credentials around for a while to allow
  // for some sort of recovery. In the simple case, a new credential shadows
  // the single, previous old credential. We could depend on creation_time, but
  // client clocks aren't always accurate, thus this field.
  //
  // In complicated cases two devices might race to replace a credential, in
  // which case (after mutual syncing) two candidate credentials exist for the
  // same (rp_id, user_id) pair because neither shadows the other. In this case
  // we pick the newest based on |creation_time| but it's quite possible that
  // some recovery will be needed because the website's server thinks the other
  // one is correct.
  //
  // A generation counter isn't used because a single device might replace a
  // series of credentials as it tries to update the website's server. But that
  // doesn't mean that it should dominate a different device that replaced it
  // only once, but later.
