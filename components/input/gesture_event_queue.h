// Despite its name, this class isn't so much one queue as it is a collection
// of queues and filters. This class applies logic to determine if an event
// should be queued, filtered altogether, or sent immediately; it tracks sent
// events and ACKs them to the clilent in the order they were dispatched. This
// class applies a series of filters and queues for various scenarios:
// 1. The sequence is filtered for bounces. A bounce is when the finger lifts
//    from the screen briefly during an in-progress scroll. If this happens,
//    non-GestureScrollUpdate events are queued until the de-bounce interval
//    passes or another GestureScrollUpdate event occurs.
// 2. Unnecessary GestureFlingCancel events are filtered by fling controller.
//    These are GestureFlingCancels that have no corresponding GestureFlingStart
//    in the queue. GestureFlingStarts are also filtered and translated to
//    scroll gestures by the fling controller.
// 3. Taps immediately after a GestureFlingCancel (caused by the same tap) are
//    filtered by fling controller.
// 4. Gesture events are queued while we're waiting to determine the allowed
//    touch actions.
// Sent events are kept in a queue until a response from the renderer is
// received for that event. The client is notified of ACKs in the order the
// events were sent, not ACK'd. This means an ACK'd event that was sent after
// an event still awaiting an ACK won't notify the client until the earlier
// event is ACK'd.
