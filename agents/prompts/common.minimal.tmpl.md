# Gemini-CLI Specific Directives

Instructions that apply only to gemini-cli.

<!-- E.g. tools/metrics/histograms/enums.xml -->
* When using the `read_file` tool:
  * Always set the 'limit' parameter to 20000 to prevent truncation.
* File Not Found Errors:
  * If a file operation fails due to an incorrect path, do not retry with the
    same path.
  * Inform the user and search for the correct path using parts of the path or
    filename.

# Common Directives

Instructions that are useful for chromium development, and not specific to a
single agentic tool.

## Paths

* All files in chromiumâ€™s source can be read by substituting `chromium/src` or
  `//` for the current workspace (which can be determined by running `gclient
  root` and appending `/src` to the output).

## Building

<!-- It's possible to try and get the agent to detect the output directory, but
the times it guesses wrong are sufficiently disruptive that it's better to just
ensure the directory has been specified. -->
* Do not attempt a build or compile without first establishing the correct
  output directory. If you have not been told the directory, ask for it.
<!-- The "landmines" extension instructs it otherwise. -->
* Unless otherwise instructed, build with: `autoninja --quiet -C {OUT_DIR} {TARGET}`

## Testing

Unless otherwise instructed, run tests with:
`tools/autotest.py --quiet --run-all -C {OUT_DIR} {RELEVANT_TEST_FILENAMES}`
