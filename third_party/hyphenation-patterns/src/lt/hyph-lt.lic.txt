%         Hyphenation patterns for Lithuanian in L7X and UTF-8 encodings.
%         \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin have to be at least 2.
%
% ==========================================
% A note about lefthyphenmin/righthyphenmin (by Sigitas, February 2009):
%
% At the moment the lefthyphenmin & righthyphenmin are both set to 2.
% The Lithuanian patterns were build earlier then the latest grammatical rules
% took place in 1997. At that time it was forbidden to leave one character at boundary.
% One may change it to one now, but from typographical point of view there is no need to do
% any changes. Even more, changing lefthyphen and righthyphen to 1 requires
% to review and maybe rebuild the patterns file.
