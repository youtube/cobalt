This directory contains scripts to collect statistics from the codebase, mostly
for use in the BlinkOn keynote presentations.

git-dirs.txt and org-list.txt are manually curated, and kept up-to-date by
keynote authors. We consider "chromium.org" addresses to be "Google", even
though in some case that is not accurate.
