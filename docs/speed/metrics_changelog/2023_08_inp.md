# Interaction to Next Paint Changes in Chrome 116

## Patched INP measurement of interactions with <select> menus on MacOS

Clicking on MacOS select menu dropdown was sometimes reporting arbitrarily long
INP because of artificial events dispatching. We [fixed](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/851b8bd317b3af1a678b72e48dbd791954e373ed)
it by identifying artificial pointerups & clicks in event timing and reporting
processingEnd as entry's ending timestamp rather than an incorrect arbitrarily
long presentation delay.

## How does this affect a site's metrics?

Pages employing select menu dropdowns may see a decrease on INP on Mac OS.

## When were users affected?

Chrome 116 was released the week of August 15, 2023.
