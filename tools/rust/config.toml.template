# Linux uses libstdc++ to build LLVM, and we want to statically link it into
# rustc. This affects how rustc links in libstdc++, not how LLVM does (which we
# build separately ourselves).
#
# For Clang, we dynamically link libstdc++, and provide the shared library along
# with the Clang binary. We could potentially do the same for Rustc in the
# future.
