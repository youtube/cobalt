/**
 * The WebContents Java wrapper to allow communicating with the native WebContents object.

 * <p>Note about serialization and {@link Parcelable}: This object is serializable and
 * deserializable as long as it is done in the same process. That means it can be passed between
 * Activities inside this process, but not preserved beyond the process lifetime. This class will
 * automatically deserialize into {@code null} if a deserialize attempt happens in another process.
 *
 * <p>To properly deserialize a custom Parcelable the right class loader must be used. See below for
 * some examples.
 *
 * <p>Intent Serialization/Deserialization Example: intent.putExtra("WEBCONTENTSKEY", webContents);
 * // ... send to other location ...
 * intent.setExtrasClassLoader(WebContents.class.getClassLoader()); webContents =
 * intent.getParcelableExtra("WEBCONTENTSKEY");
 *
 * <p>Bundle Serialization/Deserialization Example: bundle.putParcelable("WEBCONTENTSKEY",
 * webContents); // ... send to other location ...
 * bundle.setClassLoader(WebContents.class.getClassLoader()); webContents =
 * bundle.get("WEBCONTENTSKEY");
