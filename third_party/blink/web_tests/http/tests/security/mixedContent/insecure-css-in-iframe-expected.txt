CONSOLE WARNING: Mixed Content: The page at 'https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-css.html' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure stylesheet 'http://example.test:8080/security/mixedContent/resources/style.css'. This content should also be served over HTTPS.
This test loads a secure iframe that loads an insecure style sheet. We should trigger a mixed content callback because an active network attacker can use CSS3 to breach the confidentiality of the HTTPS security origin.
