  assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
[FAIL] PaymentManager interface: calling enableDelegations(sequence<PaymentDelegation>) on paymentManager with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
[FAIL] ServiceWorkerRegistration interface: attribute paymentManager
  assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "paymentManager" expected true got false
[FAIL] ServiceWorkerRegistration interface: registration must inherit property "paymentManager" with the proper type
