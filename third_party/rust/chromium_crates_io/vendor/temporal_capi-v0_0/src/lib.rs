//! This crate contains the original definitions of [`temporal_rs`] APIs consumed by [Diplomat](https://github.com/rust-diplomat/diplomat)
//! to generate FFI bindings. We currently generate bindings for C++ and `extern "C"` APIs.
//!
//! The APIs exposed by this crate are *not intended to be used from Rust* and as such this crate may change its Rust API
//! across compatible semver versions. In contrast, the `extern "C"` APIs and all the language bindings are stable within
//! the same major semver version.
