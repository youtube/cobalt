desc: |-
  Allows you to set a list of <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> features to be disabled.

        Disabling any of these features means that the user can't access it from the UI. In user sessions, the disabled features are hidden in the UI. The user experience of disabled features in Managed Guest Sessions (MGS) is decided by <ph name="SYSTEM_FEATURES_DISABLE_MODE">SystemFeaturesDisableMode</ph>; by default the users will see them as "disabled by admin".

        If the policy is left not set, all <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> features will be enabled by default and the user can use any of them.

        Note: The scanning feature is currently disabled by default via a feature flag. If the user enables the feature via the feature flag, the feature can still be disabled by this policy.
