This is a testharness.js-based test.
[PASS] Check Response's clone with default values, without body
[PASS] Check Response's clone has the expected attribute values
[PASS] Check orginal response's body after cloning
[PASS] Check cloned response's body
[PASS] Cannot clone a disturbed response
[PASS] Cloned responses should provide the same data
[PASS] Cancelling stream should not affect cloned one
[FAIL] Check response clone use structureClone for teed ReadableStreams (Int8Arraychunk)
