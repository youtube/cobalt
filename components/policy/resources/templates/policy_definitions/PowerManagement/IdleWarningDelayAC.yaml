caption: Idle warning delay when running on AC power
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  Note that this policy is deprecated and will be removed in <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> version 85. Please use <ph name="POWER_MANAGEMENT_IDLE_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">PowerManagementIdleSettings</ph> instead.

            Specifies the length of time without user input after which a warning dialog is shown when running on AC power.

            When this policy is set, it specifies the length of time that the user must remain idle before <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> shows a warning dialog telling the user that the idle action is about to be taken.

            When this policy is unset, no warning dialog is shown.

            The policy value should be specified in milliseconds. Values are clamped to be less than or equal the idle delay.

            The warning message is only shown if the idle action is to logout or shut down.
