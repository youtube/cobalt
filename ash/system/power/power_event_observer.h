// A class that observes power-management-related events - in particular, it
// observes the device suspend state and updates display states accordingly.
// When the device suspends, it suspends all displays and stops compositing.
// On resume, displays are resumed, and compositing is started again.
// During suspend, it ensures compositing is not stopped prematurely if the
// screen is being locked during suspend - display compositing will not be
// stopped before:
//  1. lock screen window is shown
//  2. wallpaper changes due to screen lock are finished
//  3. the compositor goes through at least two compositing cycles after the
//     screen lock
// This is done to ensure that displays have picked up frames from after the
// screen was locked. Without this, displays might initially show
// pre-screen-lock frames when resumed.
// For example, see https://crbug.com/807511.
