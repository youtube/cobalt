/*
 * A wrapper that owns a native side base::OnceCallback.
 *
 * You must call JniOnceCallback#destroy() if you never end up calling onResult
 * so as to not leak the native callback.
 *
 * This class has no additional thread safety measures compared to
 * base::RepeatingCallback.
 *
 * Class is package-private in order to force clients to use one of the implemented
 * interfaces (to reduce confusion of a Callback that is also a Runnable), and to
 * better document Once vs Repeated semantics.
