    expires_after="2024-02-25">
  <owner>ajgo@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>wfh@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records if CET (Control-flow Enforcement Technology / Hardware Enforced

  <summary>
    The number of drag events after a press event before we got a mouse move to
    0, 0 that is more than 200 pixels away from the current cursor position.
    This will be used to change the detection of spurious 0,0 move move events
    to a much smaller value (e.g., 20 pixels) but with the addition of a check
    that we've only received a few mouse move events, once we've determined the
    distribution of the number of drag events we receive before the 0,0 mouse
    move events. Recorded in HWNDMessageHandler::HandleMouseEventInternal when
    we see a mouse drag to 0,0 that is more than 200 pixels from the cursor
    position.

    Records whether or not the user unpinned Chrome after the installer pinned
    Chrome, on Win10+. Recorded when Chrome checks if Chrome is pinned to the
    taskbar, on startup. This check is currently done on 1% of startups. Records
    true if the installer pinned Chrome, and it's no longer pinned, false if the
    installer pinned Chrome and it's still pinned. The unpin is only recorded at
    most once per user, whereas the still pinned state is recorded on every
