caption: Print PDF as Image Default
default: false
desc: |-
  Controls if <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> makes the Print as image option default to set when printing PDFs.

        When this policy is set to Enabled, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will default to setting the Print as image option in the Print Preview when printing a PDF.

        When this policy is set to Disabled or not set <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> then the user selection for Print as image option will be initially unset.  The user will be allowed to select it for each individual PDFs print job, if the option is available.

        For <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph> or <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph> this policy only has an effect if <ph name="PRINT_PDF_AS_IMAGE_AVAILABILITY_POLICY_NAME">PrintPdfAsImageAvailability</ph> is also enabled.
