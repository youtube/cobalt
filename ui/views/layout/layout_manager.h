//
// . Provides preferred sizing information, see GetPreferredSize() and
//   GetPreferredHeightForWidth().
// . To position and size (aka layout) the children of the associated View. See
//   Layout() for details.
//
// How a LayoutManager operates is specific to the LayoutManager. Non-trivial
// LayoutManagers calculate preferred size and layout information using the
// minimum and preferred size of the children of the View. That is, they
// make use of View::GetMinimumSize(), View::CalculatePreferredSize() and/or
// View::GetHeightForWidth().
