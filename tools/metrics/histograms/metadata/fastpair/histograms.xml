    pairing scenarios. Emitted on the following steps: initialization started

    is already pairing when the notification is clicked), passed to pairing
    dialog (when a V1 device is detected, indicated that the device will not be
    logging the subsequent metrics in the flow), exhausted retries failure (on
    failure after three retry attempts), handshake reused (when a GATT handshake
    already exists, bypassing the GATT handshake flow for this attempt), and
