Test ensures that if an autoscroll starts from within an entry field, it does not propagate to its non-scrollable overflow ancestors.

To test manually, start text selecting with a mouse the text within the entry field. Then continue to drag the mouse out of the input field boundary.
Scrolling should not propagate to the container overflown div due to its "overflow:hidden"

 

Test succeeded!
