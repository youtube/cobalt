caption: Auto update scatter factor
desc: Specifies the number of seconds up to which a device may randomly delay its
  download of an update from the time the update was first pushed out to the server.
  The device may wait a portion of this time in terms of wall-clock-time and the remaining
  portion in terms of the number of update checks. In any case, the scatter is upper
  bounded to a constant amount of time so that a device does not ever get stuck waiting
  to download an update forever.
