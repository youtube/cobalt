caption: Configure a list of origins that grant extended background lifetime to the connecting extensions.
desc: |-
  Extensions that connect to one of these origins will be be kept running as long as the port is connected.

  If unset, the policy's default values will be used. These are app origins that offer SDKs that are known to not offer the possibility to restart a closed connection to a previous state:
  - Smart Card Connector
  - Citrix Receiver (stable, beta, back-up)
  - VMware Horizon (stable, beta)

  If set, the default value list is extended with the newly configured values. Both defaults and the policy-provided entries will grant the exception to the connecting extensions, as long as the port is connected.
