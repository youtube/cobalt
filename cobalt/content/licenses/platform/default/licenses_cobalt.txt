      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library

  Software License for The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android
  © Copyright  1995 - 2013 Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V.
    All rights reserved.
  1.    INTRODUCTION
  The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android ("FDK AAC Codec") is software that implements
  the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding ("AAC") encoding and decoding scheme for digital audio.
  This FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on a wide variety of Android devices.
  AAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient general perceptual
  audio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing full-bandwidth communications codec by
  independent studies and is widely deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part
  of the MPEG specifications.
  Patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including those of Fraunhofer)
  may be obtained through Via Licensing (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners
  individually for the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant with
  the ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of Android devices already license
  these patent claims through Via Licensing or directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec
  software may already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those licensed purposes only.
  Commercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions with enhanced sound quality,
  are also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional
  applications information and documentation.
  2.    COPYRIGHT LICENSE
  Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted without
  payment of copyright license fees provided that you satisfy the following conditions:
  You must retain the complete text of this software license in redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or
  your modifications thereto in source code form.
  You must retain the complete text of this software license in the documentation and/or other materials
  provided with redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or your modifications thereto in binary form.
  You must make available free of charge copies of the complete source code of the FDK AAC Codec and your
  modifications thereto to recipients of copies in binary form.
  The name of Fraunhofer may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this library without
  prior written permission.
  You may not charge copyright license fees for anyone to use, copy or distribute the FDK AAC Codec
  software or your modifications thereto.
  Your modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the software
  and the date of any change. For modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec, the term
  "Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android" must be replaced by the term
  "Third-Party Modified Version of the Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android."
  3.    NO PATENT LICENSE
  NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED LICENSES TO ANY PATENT CLAIMS, including without limitation the patents of Fraunhofer,
  ARE GRANTED BY THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE. Fraunhofer provides no warranty of patent non-infringement with
  respect to this software.
  You may use this FDK AAC Codec software or modifications thereto only for purposes that are authorized
  by appropriate patent licenses.
  4.    DISCLAIMER
  This FDK AAC Codec software is provided by Fraunhofer on behalf of the copyright holders and contributors
  "AS IS" and WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, including but not limited to the implied warranties
  of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR
  CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages,
  including but not limited to procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits,
  or business interruption, however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict
  liability, or tort (including negligence), arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if
  advised of the possibility of such damage.

  boringssl


  BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
  licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
  license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

  Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
  https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

  Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as described therein. The MIT
  license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories, is
  compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
  OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
  for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
  licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
  openssl-core@openssl.org.

  The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
  some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
  record keeping.)

     combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case
     including portions thereof.

     1.4. "Electronic Distribution Mechanism" means a mechanism generally
     accepted in the software development community for the electronic
     transfer of data.

     1.5. "Executable" means Covered Code in any form other than Source

     differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
     well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The
     Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
     appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available
     for no charge.

     1.12. "You" (or "Your")  means an individual or a legal entity
     exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this

     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
     claims:
          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
          as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
          selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
          Original Code (or portions thereof).

          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
          Original Code under the terms of this License.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
          Version (or portions of such combination).

          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
          the Covered Code.

          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
          that Contributor.

  3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

  5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

  6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

  7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

  8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

  11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

  12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

  13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

  Academic Free License v. 2.0
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
  authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
  following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
  Work:

  Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.0
  1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
  royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
  following:

  a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
  b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
     Work;
  c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
     public;
  d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
  e) to display the Original Work publicly.

  2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
  royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
  claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
  Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
  Original Work and Derivative Works.

  3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
  form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
  documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
  agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
  Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
  Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
  machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
  reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
  long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
  the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
  the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

  4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
  of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
  service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
  Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
  in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
  patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
  expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
  offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
  defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
  such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
  interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
  License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
  license.

  5) This section intentionally omitted.

  6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
  Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
  Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
  descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
  the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
  Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
  modified the Original Work.

  7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
  the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
  by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
  of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
  and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
  sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
  and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
  the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
  This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
  license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

  8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
  Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
  or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
  or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
  of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
  apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
  negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
  consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

  9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
  a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
  obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
  else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
  grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
  or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
  to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
  between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
  equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
  exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
  Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

  10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
  and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
  as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
  for patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a patent
  applicable to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a patent
  applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the Original
  Work with other software or hardware).

  11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
  License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
  Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
  the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
  scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
  requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 101 et seq.,
  the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section
  shall survive the termination of this License.

  12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
  seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
  recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
  attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
  any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
  License.

  13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
  the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
  make it enforceable.

  14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
  in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
  under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
  entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
  under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
  (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
  entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
  (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
  entity.

  15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
  restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
  to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

  This license is Copyright (C) 2003 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.
  Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without
  modification. This license may not be modified without the express written
  permission of its copyright owner.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
     claims:
          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
          as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
          selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
          Original Code (or portions thereof).

          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
          Original Code under the terms of this License.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
          Version (or portions of such combination).

          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
          the Covered Code.

          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
          that Contributor.

  3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

  5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

  6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

  7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

  8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO

     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

  13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under

                      The FreeType Project LICENSE
                      ----------------------------

                              2006-Jan-27

                      Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
            David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



  Introduction
  ============

    The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
    various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
    FreeType Project.

    This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
    which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
    affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

      o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
        interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

      o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
        full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

      o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
        it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
        somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
        FreeType code. (`credits')

    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


    Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
    encourage you to use the following text:

     """
      Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
      Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
     """

    Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
    actually use.


  Legal Terms
  ===========

  0. Definitions
  --------------

    Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
    and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
    distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
    beta or final release.

    `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
    engine'.

    This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.

    The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
    specified below.

  1. No Warranty
  --------------

    THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
    WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

  2. Redistribution
  -----------------

    This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
    irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
    display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
    sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
    forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
    authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
    herein, subject to the following conditions:

      o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
        (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
        the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
        documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
        original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
        files.

      o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
        states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
        FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
        encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
        documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

    These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
    the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
    our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
    to us.

  3. Advertising
  --------------

    Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
    the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
    purposes without specific prior written permission.

    We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
    following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
    or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
    `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

    As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
    accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
    material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
    authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
    Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
    Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
    of this license.

  4. Contacts
  -----------

    There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

      o freetype@nongnu.org

        Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
        future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
        If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
        haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

      o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

        Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
        specific licenses, porting, etc.

  libjpeg-turbo

  libjpeg-turbo Licenses libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style
  open source licenses:

  The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed below

  Origin

  This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.

  The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
  with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
  fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and
  you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

  This software is copyright (C) 1994-1996, Thomas G. Lane.
  All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

  Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
  software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to
  these conditions:
  (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then
  this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty
  notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original
  files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
  (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
  documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work
  of the Independent JPEG Group".
  (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
  full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
  NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

  These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG
  code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought
  to acknowledge us.

 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company
  name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products
  derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent
  JPEG Group's software".

  We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis
  of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
  assumed by the product vendor.


  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs (any
  code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)

  The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below

  This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as well
  as the build system.

  The zlib License

  This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
  SIMD extensions.

  Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses This section provides a roll-up of
  the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the best of our understanding.

  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then:

  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices from the
  source.

  Origin

  Clause 1 of the IJG License Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License Clauses 1 and
  3 of the zlib License You must add your own copyright notice to the header of
  each source file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file
  (if there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
  simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

  Origin

  Clause 1 of the IJG License Clause 2 of the zlib License You must include the
  IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the copyright or license text
  in that file.

  Origin

  Clause 1 of the IJG License If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo
  binaries without the source, or if you are distributing an application that
  statically links with libjpeg-turbo, then:

  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

  This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.

  Origin

  Clause 2 of the IJG license If your binary distribution includes or uses the
  TurboJPEG API, then your product documentation must include the text of the
  Modified BSD License (see below.)

  Origin

  Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License You cannot use the name of the IJG or The
  libjpeg-turbo Project or the contributors thereof in advertising, publicity,
  etc.

  Origin

  IJG License Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo
  Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be free of defects, nor do we accept
  any liability for undesirable consequences resulting from your use of the
  software.

  Origin

  IJG License Modified BSD License zlib License The Modified (3-clause) BSD
  License Copyright (C)2009-2021 D. R. Commander. All Rights Reserved.
  Copyright (C)2015 Viktor Szathmáry. All Rights Reserved.

  Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

  Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this
  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.  Redistributions in binary
  form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and
  the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided
  with the distribution.  Neither the name of the libjpeg-turbo Project nor the
  names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived
  from this software without specific prior written permission.  THIS SOFTWARE
  IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS", AND ANY EXPRESS
  OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO
  EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
  INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING,
  BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE,
  DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
  OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE,
  EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

  Why Three Licenses?  The zlib License could have been used instead of the
  Modified (3-clause) BSD License, and since the IJG License effectively
  subsumes the distribution conditions of the zlib License, this would have
  effectively placed libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.
  However, the IJG License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and
  does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.
  Thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same
  protections for new code that were granted to the IJG for code derived from
  their software.

  Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
  no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
  patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,

  License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

    0. Additional Definitions.

    As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
  General Public License.

    "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

    An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
  by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
  of using an interface provided by the Library.

    A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
  Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
  Version".

    The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

    The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
  and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

    1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    2. Conveying Modified Versions.

    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
  version:

     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
     ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
     function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
     whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
     this License applicable to that copy.

    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
  code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
  (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

    4. Combined Works.

    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
     the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
     execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
     these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
     copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     d) Do one of the following:

         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
         License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
         suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
         recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
         the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
         manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
         Corresponding Source.

         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
         Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
         a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
         system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
         of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
         Version.

     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
     be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
     GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
     necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
     Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
     Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
     you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
     the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
     Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
     Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
     for conveying Corresponding Source.)

    5. Combined Libraries.

    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
     on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
     conveyed under the terms of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
     is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
  apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
  permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
  Library.

                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                         Version 3, 29 June 2007

   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                              Preamble

    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
  software and other kinds of works.

    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
  freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
  or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
  know their rights.

    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
  that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
  authors of previous versions.

    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
  can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
  protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
  products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
  make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    0. Definitions.

    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.

    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  on the Program.

    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  public, and in some countries other activities as well.

    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

    1. Source Code.

    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
  form of a work.

    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
  is widely used among developers working in that language.

    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
  subprograms and other parts of the work.

    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
  Source.

    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
  same work.

    2. Basic Permissions.

    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
  makes it unnecessary.

    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
  measures.

    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
  technological measures.

    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
      it, and giving a relevant date.

      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
      released under this License and any conditions added under section
      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
      "keep intact all notices".

      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
      work need not make them do so.

    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
  parts of the aggregate.

    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
  in one of these ways:

      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
      customarily used for software interchange.

      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
      with subsection 6b.

      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
      charge under subsection 6d.

    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  included in conveying the object code work.

    A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
  the only significant mode of use of the product.

    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
  modification has been made.

    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
  been installed in ROM).

    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
  protocols for communication across the network.

    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
  unpacking, reading or copying.

    7. Additional Terms.

    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
  this License without regard to the additional permissions.

    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
      Notices displayed by works containing it; or

      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or

      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
      those licensors and authors.

    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
  restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
  not survive such relicensing or conveying.

    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
  where to find the applicable terms.

    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
  the above requirements apply either way.

    8. Termination.

    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
  paragraph of section 11).

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
  your receipt of the notice.

    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
  material under section 10.

    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

    11. Patents.

    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
  this License.

    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
  propagate the contents of its contributor version.

    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
  sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
  patent against the party.

    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
  license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
  country that you have reason to believe are valid.

    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
  work and works based on it.

    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
  combination as such.

    14. Revised Versions of this License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
  by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
  to choose that version for the Program.

    Later license versions may give you additional or different
  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
  later version.

    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
  IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    16. Limitation of Liability.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.

    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
  copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
      This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
  into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
  the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
  Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
  <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

  pulseaudio(headers only)


  All PulseAudio source files, except as noted below, are licensed under the GNU
  Lesser General Public License. (see file LGPL for details)

  However, the server side has optional GPL dependencies.  These include the
  libsamplerate and gdbm (core libraries), LIRC (lirc module) and FFTW (equalizer
  module), although others may also be included in the future.  If PulseAudio is
  compiled with these optional components, this effectively downgrades the
  license of the server part to GPL (see the file GPL for details), exercising
  section 3 of the LGPL.  In such circumstances, you should treat the client
  library (libpulse) of PulseAudio as being LGPL licensed and the server part
  (libpulsecore) as being GPL licensed.  Since the PulseAudio daemon, tests,
  various utilities/helpers and the modules link to libpulsecore and/or the afore
  mentioned optional GPL dependencies they are of course also GPL licensed also
  in this scenario.

  In addition to this, if D-Bus support is enabled, the PulseAudio client library
  (libpulse) MAY need to be licensed under the GPL, depending on the license
  adopted for libdbus. libdbus is licensed under either of the Academic Free
  License 2.1 or GPL 2.0 or above. Which of these applies is your choice, and the
  result affects the licensing of libpulse and thus, potentially, all programs
  that link to libpulse.

  Andre Adrian's echo cancellation implementation is licensed under a less
  restrictive license - see src/modules/echo-cancel/adrian-license.txt for
  details.

  Some other files pulled into PA source (i.e. reference implementations that are
  considered too small and stable to be considered as an external library) use the
  more permissive MIT license. These include the device reservation DBus protocol
  and realtime kit implementations.

  A more permissive BSD-style license is used for LFE filters, see
  src/pulsecore/filter/LICENSE.WEBKIT for details.

  Additionally, a more permissive Sun license is used for code that performs
  u-law, A-law and linear PCM conversions.

  While we attempt to provide a summary here, it is the ultimate responsibility of
  the packager to ensure the components they use in their build of PulseAudio
  meets their license requirements.

                      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                         Version 2.1, February 1999

   Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
   as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
   the version number 2.1.]

                              Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.

    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.

                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
      in the event an application does not supply such function or
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
      its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
      root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
  these notices.

    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
  of these things:

      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
      to use the modified definitions.)

      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
      least three years, to give the same user the materials
      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
      than the cost of performing this distribution.

      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
      specified materials from the same place.

      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.

    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
      Sections above.

      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.

    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.

    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

                              NO WARRANTY

    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
      Lesser General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
    library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents) ------------------------------------
  "These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the
  WebM codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project.  Google
  hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
  royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
  license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer,
  and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of these
  implementations of WebM, where such license applies only to those patent
  claims, both currently owned by Google and acquired in the future,
  licensable by Google that are necessarily infringed by these
  implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims that would be
  infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these
  implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or
  order or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent
  enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or
  counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of
  WebM or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM
  constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of
  patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this
  License for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date
  such litigation is filed.
