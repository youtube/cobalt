This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] [layerNormalization] Test with nonconsecutive axes.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'layerNormalization' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported rank 6 for argument input (must be at most 5)."
[FAIL] [layerNormalization] Test with axes in descending order.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'layerNormalization' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported rank 6 for argument input (must be at most 5)."
[FAIL] [layerNormalization] Throw if the input data type is not one of the floating point types.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint32 for input operand named 'input', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
