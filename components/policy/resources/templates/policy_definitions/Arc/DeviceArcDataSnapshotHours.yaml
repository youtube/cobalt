caption: Intervals when ARC data snapshot update process can be started for Managed
  Guest Sessions
desc: 'If "DeviceArcDataSnapshotHours" policy is set, then the ARC data snapshotting
  mechanism is turned on. And the ARC data snapshot update can be started automatically
  during the defined time intervals. When an interval starts, ARC data snapshot update
  is required and no user is logged-in, the ARC data snapshot update process is started
  without user notification. If the user session is active, the UI notification is
  shown and have to be accepted in order to reboot a device and start ARC data snapshot
  update process. Note: a device is blocked for usage during the ARC data snapshot
  update process.'
