caption: Block JavaScript from using JIT on these sites
desc: |-
  Allows you to set a list of site url patterns that specify sites which are not allowed to run JavaScript JIT (Just In Time) compiler enabled.

            Disabling the JavaScript JIT will mean that <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> may render web content more slowly, and may also disable parts of JavaScript including WebAssembly. Disabling the JavaScript JIT may allow <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to render web content in a more secure configuration.

            For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. Wildcards, <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph>, are allowed.

            JavaScript JIT policy exceptions will only be enforced at a site granularity (eTLD+1). A policy set for only subdomain.site.com will not correctly apply to site.com or subdomain.site.com since they both resolve to the same eTLD+1 (site.com) for which there is no policy. In this case, policy must be set on site.com to apply correctly for both site.com and subdomain.site.com.

            This policy applies on a frame-by-frame basis and not based on top level origin url alone, so e.g. if site-one.com is listed in the <ph name="JAVA_SCRIPT_JIT_BLOCKED_FOR_SITES_POLICY_NAME">JavaScriptJitBlockedForSites</ph> policy but site-one.com loads a frame containing site-two.com then site-one.com will have JavaScript JIT disabled, but site-two.com will use the policy from <ph name="DEFAULT_JAVA_SCRIPT_JIT_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultJavaScriptJitSetting</ph>, if set, or default to JavaScript JIT enabled.

            If this policy is not set for a site then the policy from <ph name="DEFAULT_JAVA_SCRIPT_JIT_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultJavaScriptJitSetting</ph> applies to the site, if set, otherwise JavaScript JIT is enabled for the site.
