  Enable the low battery sound feature.

            This feature is responsible to play the low battery sound.

            If this policy is set to enabled, the low battery sound will be played when the battery level or the remaining time drops below a threshold.

            If this policy is set to disabled, no low battery sound will be played.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, this feature is disabled for existing users, or enabled for new users initially on the managed <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> devices, but users can enable or disable it at any time.
