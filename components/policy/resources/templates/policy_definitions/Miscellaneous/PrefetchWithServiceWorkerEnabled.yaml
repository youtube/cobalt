caption: Allow SpeculationRules prefetch to ServiceWorker-controlled URLs
desc: |-
  SpeculationRules prefetch can be issued to URLs that are controlled by
  ServiceWorker. However, legacy code did not allow it and canceled the prefetch
  requests. This policy enables to control the behavior.

  Setting this policy to Enabled or not set allows SpeculationRules prefetch to
  ServiceWorker-controlled URLs (if the PrefetchServiceWorker feature flag is
  enabled). This is the current default behavior and is aligned with the
  specifications.

  Setting this policy to Disabled disallows SpeculationRules prefetch to
  ServiceWorker-controlled URLs. This is the legacy behavior.

  This policy is intended to be temporary and will be removed in the future.
