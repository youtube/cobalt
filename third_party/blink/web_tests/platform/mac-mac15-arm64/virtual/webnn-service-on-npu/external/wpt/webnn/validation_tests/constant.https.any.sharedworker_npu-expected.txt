[FAIL] [constant] Test building a constant with int64 data type
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'constant' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int64 for constant, must be one of [float32, float16, int32, uint32, int8, uint8, int4, uint4]."
