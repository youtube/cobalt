caption: Number of milestones rollback is allowed
desc: |-
  Specifies the minimum number of <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> milestones rollback should be allowed starting from the stable version at any time.

        Default is 0 for consumer, 4 (approx. half a year) for enterprise enrolled devices.

        Setting this policy prevents rollback protection to apply for at least this number of milestones.

        Setting this policy to a lower value has a permanent effect: the device MAY not be able to roll back to earlier versions even after the policy is reset to a larger value.

        Actual rollback possibilities may also depend on the board and critical vulnerability patches.
