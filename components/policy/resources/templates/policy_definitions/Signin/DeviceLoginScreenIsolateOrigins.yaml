caption: Enable Site Isolation for specified origins
deprecated: true
desc: "\n      This policy was removed in M77.\n      This policy applies to the sign-in\
  \ screen. Please see also the <ph name=\"ISOLATE_ORIGINS_POLICY_NAME\">IsolateOrigins</ph>\
  \ policy which applies to the user session.\n      If the policy is enabled, each\
  \ of the named origins in a comma-separated list will run in its own process. This\
  \ will also isolate origins named by subdomains; e.g. specifying https://example.com/\
  \ will also cause https://foo.example.com/ to be isolated as part of the https://example.com/\
  \ site.\n      If the policy is not configured or disabled, the platform default\
  \ site isolation settings will be used for the sign-in screen.\n      "
