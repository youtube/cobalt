// List of user segment types.
// There are two types of user segments:
//   - Server model segments: These segments support receiving updated models
//     from a server, and its values must be less than MAX_OPTIMIZATION_TARGET.
//   - Default model segments: These segments only support a client-side default
//     model, its values must be greater than MAX_OPTIMIZATION_TARGET.
//
// All new SegmentIds should be added to the following locations:
//   1. The list of segmentation client keys in
//      components/segmentation_platform/public/constants.h.
//   2. Histogram variant must be added to SegmentationModel in
//      tools/metrics/histograms/metadata/segmentation_platform/histograms.xml.
//
// New server model segments must be added to the following locations:
//   - OptimizationTargetProto in
//     components/optimization_guide/proto/models.proto.
//   - SegmentationPlatformSegmentationModel enum in
//     tools/metrics/histograms/enums.xml
