# Custom Theme Support

This directory contains support for custom themes in Chrome, both those
installed from the web store and those autogenerated from the color picker
accessible from the "Customize Chrome" button on the New Tab Page. The two
primary classes are the [`BrowserThemePack`](browser_theme_pack.h), which
handles representation of a custom theme and serialization to/from disk; and
[`ThemeService`](theme_service.h), which other code uses to access
theme-specific functionality (e.g. painting appropriate background images).
