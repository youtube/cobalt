# default.cfg will change whenever a CL modifies the set of builders launched by
# CQ for all changes (modulo the default excludes). If changes are made that
# only change the paths for some builders, then only full.cfg will be changed.
# CQ usage secondary owners can approve benign path changes but should defer to
# above if the path might have a large impact on capacity.
