caption: Update Time Restrictions
desc: |-
  This policy controls the time frames during which the <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> device is not allowed to check for updates automatically.
        When this policy is set to a non-empty list of time intervals:
        Devices will not be able to check for updates automatically during the specified time intervals. Devices that require an enterprise rollback or are below the minimum <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> version will not be affected by this policy due to potential security issues. Furthermore, this policy will not block update checks requested by users or administrators.
        Starting from M88, this policy cancels an ongoing update when a restricted time interval is reached. The next auto update after the restricted time interval ends will automatically resume the update. Devices updating to a Quick Fix Build will not be affected by this policy.
        When this policy is unset or contains no time intervals:
        No automatic update checks will be blocked by this policy, but they may be blocked by other policies.
        Till M88, this feature is only enabled on <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> devices configured as auto-launch kiosks. Other devices will not be restricted by this policy. However starting from M89, this policy is enabled on all <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> devices.
