// ResourceProgressEvent is a non-standard class that is simply a ProgressEvent
// with an additional read-only "url" property containing a string URL. This is
// used by the Chromium NaCl integration to indicate to which resource the
// event applies. This is useful because the NaCl integration will download
// (and translate in the case of PNaCl) multiple binary files. It is not
// constructable by web content at all, and so does not provide the usual
// EventInit pattern for Event construction.
