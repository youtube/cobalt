caption: Control Manifest v2 extension availability
desc: |-
  Control if Manifest v2 extensions can be used on the <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> sign-in screen.

  Manifest v2 extensions support will be deprecated and all extensions need
  to be migrated to v3 in the future. More information and timeline of the
  migration can be found at https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/.

  If the policy is set to <ph name="DEFAULT">Default</ph> (0) or not set, v2 extensions loading are decided by device, following the timeline above.
  If the policy is set to <ph name="DISABLE">Disable</ph> (1), v2 extensions installation are blocked, existing ones are disabled. The option is going to be treated the same as if the policy is not set after v2 support is turned off by default.
  If the policy is set to <ph name="ENABLE">Enable</ph> (2), v2 extensions are allowed. The option is going to be treated the same as if the policy is not set before v2 support is turned off by default.
  If the policy is set to <ph name="ENABLE_FOR_FORCED_EXTENSIONS">EnableForForcedExtensions</ph> (3), force installed v2 extensions are allowed. This includes extensions that are listed by <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_FORCELIST_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionInstallForcelist</ph> or <ph name="EXTENSION_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionSettings</ph> with <ph name="INSTALLATION_MODE">installation_mode</ph> "force_installed" or "normal_installed". All other v2 extensions are disabled. The option is always available regardless of the migration state.


  Extensions availability are still controlled by other policies.
