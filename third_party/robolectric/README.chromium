Description: Robolectric is a unit test framework for Android.
Local Modifications:
- Added custom_asynctask folder to have workable copies of shadows required
  for our own implementation of AsyncTask.
How To Update:
- First CL:
  - Add new version and URL to 3pp/fetch.py for the android_all jar.
  - Update the old versions to the latest instrumented versioned files
    for backwards compatibility.
  - Update robolectric version in third_party/android_deps/build.gradle.
  - Run `third_party/android_deps/fetch_all.py --local --ignore-vulnerabilities`
  - Upload a CL without DEPS and BUILD.gn changes.
- Kickoff 3pp run:
  - Open ci.chromium.org
  - Click "Scheduler", find the 3pp linux bot and start it.
  - Once finished get the instance hash from
    https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/p/chromium/third_party/robolectric
- Second CL:
  - Add new version(s) as data to third_party/robolectric/BUILD.gn.
  - Update DEPS to point to new cipd instance.
  - Apply any other DEPS and BUILD.gn changes from running
    `third_party/android_deps/fetch_all.py --local --ignore-vulnerabilities`
