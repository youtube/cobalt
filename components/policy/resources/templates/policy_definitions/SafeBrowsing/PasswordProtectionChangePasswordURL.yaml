caption: Configure the change password URL.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy sets the URL for users to change their password after seeing a warning in the browser. The password protection service sends users to the URL (HTTP and HTTPS protocols only) you designate through this policy. For <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to correctly capture the salted hash of the new password on this change password page, make sure your change password page follows these guidelines ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms ).

  Turning the policy off or leaving it unset means the service sends users to https://myaccount.google.com to change their password.

  On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph>, this policy is only available on instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> domain, joined to <ph name="MS_AAD_NAME">Microsoft® Azure® Active Directory®</ph> or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>.
