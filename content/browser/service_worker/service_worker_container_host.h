// ServiceWorkerContainerHost is the host of a service worker client (a window,
// dedicated worker, or shared worker) or service worker execution context in
// the renderer process.
//
// Most of its functionality helps implement the web-exposed
// ServiceWorkerContainer interface (navigator.serviceWorker). The long-term
// goal is for it to be the host of ServiceWorkerContainer in the renderer,
// although currently only windows support ServiceWorkerContainers (see
// https://crbug.com/371690).
//
// ServiceWorkerContainerHost is also responsible for handling service worker
// related things in the execution context where the container lives. For
// example, the container host manages service worker (registration) JavaScript
// object hosts, delivers messages to/from the service worker, and dispatches
// events on the container.
//
// Ownership model and responsibilities of ServiceWorkerContainerHost are
// slightly different based on the type of the execution context that the
// container host serves:
//
// For service worker clients, ServiceWorkerContainerHost is owned by
// ServiceWorkerContextCore. The container host has a Mojo connection to the
// container in the renderer, and destruction of the container host happens upon
// disconnection of the Mojo pipe.
//
// For service worker clients, the container host works as a source of truth of
// a service worker client.
//
// Example:
// When a new service worker registration is created, the browser process
// iterates over all ServiceWorkerContainerHosts to find clients (frames,
// dedicated workers if PlzDedicatedWorker is enabled, and shared workers) with
// a URL inside the registration's scope, and has the container host watch the
// registration in order to resolve navigator.serviceWorker.ready once the
// registration settles, if need.
//
// For service worker execution contexts, ServiceWorkerContainerHost is owned
// by ServiceWorkerHost, which in turn is owned by ServiceWorkerVersion. The
// container host and worker host are destructed when the service worker is
// stopped.
