  TimestampsDiscrepancy quantifies the largest area of jank observed in a series
  of timestamps.  Note that this is different from metrics based on the
  max_time_interval. For example, the time stamp series A = [0,1,2,3,5,6] and
  B = [0,1,2,3,5,7] have the same max_time_interval = 2, but
  Discrepancy(B) > Discrepancy(A).

  Two variants of discrepancy can be computed:

  Relative discrepancy is following the original definition of
  discrepancy. It characterized the largest area of jank, relative to the
  duration of the entire time stamp series.  We normalize the raw results,
  because the best case discrepancy for a set of N samples is 1/N (for
  equally spaced samples), and we want our metric to report 0.0 in that
  case.

  Absolute discrepancy also characterizes the largest area of jank, but its
  value wouldn't change (except for imprecisions due to a low
  |interval_multiplier|) if additional 'good' intervals were added to an
  exisiting list of time stamps.  Its range is [0,inf] and the unit is
  milliseconds.

  The time stamp series C = [0,2,3,4] and D = [0,2,3,4,5] have the same
  absolute discrepancy, but D has lower relative discrepancy than C.

  |timestamps| may be a list of lists S = [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N], where each
  S_i is a time stamp series. In that case, the discrepancy D(S) is:
  D(S) = max(D(S_1), D(S_2), ..., D(S_N))
