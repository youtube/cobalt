# Introduction

app_shell is an experimental project to build a minimal environment like
content_shell.

The goal is to be able to run a v2 app and supply most of the chrome.* extension
APIs without running the rest of Chrome.

app_shell is only officially supported on Chrome OS.

# How to run

$ app_shell --load-apps=/path/to/extension

# For example, you can try the calculator app:

$ app_shell --load-apps=chrome/test/data/extensions/calculator_app/app/

# To load multiple apps, specify them in a comma separated list.  The first app
# will be launched:

$ app_shell --load-apps=/path/to/extension1,/path/to/extension2
