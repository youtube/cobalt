Test for chromium bug : 396655. Tables with specific merge cell configuration render with extra height to tr elements.

We have the below table. Because cell A and cell D overlap in the second row, the height of the second row is the 1px difference between A and B and the 1px difference between C and D.

+-----+-----+
|     |  B  |
|  A  +-----+
|     |     |
+-----+  D  |
|  C  |     |
+-----+-----+
