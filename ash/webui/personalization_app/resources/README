The time-of-day resources cannot be made public until after the feature has been
launched. Thus, they are currently hosted in CIPD and downloaded to this
directory only if an internal chrome-branded checkout is being used. To update
the assets in cipd:
* `cd` to this directory in your local checkout
* Update the time_of_day/ directory locally with desired changes.
* Rebuild and test it.
* `cipd auth-login`
* `cipd create -pkg-def=cipd_time_of_day.yaml`. Outputs something like this:

Instance: chromeos_internal/assistant/time_of_day:<version_id>
 â€¢ Instance chromeos_internal/assistant/time_of_day:<version_id> was successfully registered

* Open chromium/src/DEPS and find "src/ash/webui/personalization_app/resources".
  Update the "version" field to the <version_id> printed above.
