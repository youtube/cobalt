This directory contains the accelerated_widget_mac ui component. The main
exported class is AcceleratedWidgetMac, which owns a tree of Core Animation
CALayers that are placed into an NSView provided by the
AcceleratedWidgetMacNSView client class.

AcceleratedWidgetMac receives frames from the compositor and ensures it has
appropriate layers for rendering that frame type into the NSView.
