This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] prelu float32 0D scalar
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Slope should not be a scalar."
[FAIL] prelu float32 2D tensors
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."
[FAIL] prelu float32 3D tensors
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."
[FAIL] prelu float32 4D tensors
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."

  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."
[FAIL] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 1D slope of shape [1]
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': The input and slope should have the same last dimension."
[FAIL] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 2D slope
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Expected all dimensions of slope to be 1 except the last dimension."
[FAIL] prelu float32 broadcast 4D x 4D slope
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': The input and slope should have the same last dimension."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
