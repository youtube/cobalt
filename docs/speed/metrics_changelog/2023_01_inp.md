# Interaction to Next Paint Changes in Chrome 109

## Chrome prioritizes compositing after input events

A change in the Chrome scheduler to prioritize rendering after user interaction
resulted in multiple improvements to user-experienced Interaction to Next Paint.

Applications with a large amount of typing on desktop saw improvements to their
slowest interaction times as many keypresses right after another displayed on
screen more quickly.

Mobile sites in which users were tapping multiple times due to slow interactions
saw large improvements to interaction times, as 500ms+ interactions no longer
"piled up" waiting for the user to stop tapping before the screen began to update.

Source code of the change is linked [in the chromium issue tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=853771)

## When were users affected?

Chrome 109 was released the week of January 10, 2023.
