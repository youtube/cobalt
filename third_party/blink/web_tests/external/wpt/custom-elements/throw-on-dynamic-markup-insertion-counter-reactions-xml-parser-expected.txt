PASS document.write must throw an InvalidStateError when processing custom element reactions for a synchronous constructed custom element
PASS document.writeln must throw an InvalidStateError when processing custom element reactions for a synchronous constructed custom element
PASS document.open() of another document must not throw an InvalidStateError when processing custom element reactions for a synchronous constructed custom element
PASS document.open("text/html") of another document must not throw an InvalidStateError when processing custom element reactions for a synchronous constructed custom element
PASS document.close() of another document must not throw an InvalidStateError when processing custom element reactions for a synchronous constructed custom element
PASS document.write of another document must not throw an InvalidStateError when processing custom element reactions for a synchronous constructed custom element
PASS document.writeln of another document must not throw an InvalidStateError when processing custom element reactions for a synchronous constructed custom element
