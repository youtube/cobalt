The listed token sequences will be removed from input before checking for any Pedal matches. Context: The user is typing into the omnibox to find some setting or action, and the way to describe it isn't obvious. For example, they may be looking for chrome://settings/clearBrowserData but they type 'clear my history' or 'delete the browser data'. The Pedals system can identify the meaning of 'clear', 'delete', 'history', and 'browsing data' but 'the' and 'my' in this context are unnecessary extra words (sometimes called 'stop words'). The IGNORE group is the list of the most common words that users may type but which don't convey the necessary specific meaning for Pedals actions. Don't translate this list word for word; rather, consider and list any words that may be unnecessarily included in queries written by users who speak the target language. If a language doesn't have any such words, the list may be empty.">
