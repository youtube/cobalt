# Cronet API code

This directory contains code that is shipped in the Cronet API library. The
Cronet API library is directly embedded in apps and is only updated when app
developers decide to pull a new version to include in their app.

Exception: when Cronet is built as part of AOSP, this code is an implementation
detail of `HttpEngine` and is updated just like the rest of AOSP Cronet.
