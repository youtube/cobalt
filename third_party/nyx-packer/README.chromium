Description:
Nyx Packer is used to create a Nyx sharedir, which contains bundled data
required to run a virtual machine for a given fuzz testing (fuzzing) target.
The only file used from this library is 'nyx.h' for the low-level interface
definitions.

Local Modifications:
We add 'get.sh', which is an aid for creating a CL to roll our copy of the
'nyx.h' header file. It fetches the latest version of 'nyx.h' from the upstream
repository and then updates this README file with the latest commit hash and
date.
