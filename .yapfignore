# Ideally all third-party code should be ignored by default.
# Unfortunately yapfignore doesn't support negative pattern (they use fnmatch)
# and is searched from current working directory instead of where the file is
# located. We won't be able to override the config to enable yapf for some
# files under third_party/*.
# Though this is done by git_cl.py anyway since yapfignore is ignored when file
# list is provided explicitly.

# Thers is no consistent way to ignore python code here unless we make yapf
# properly implement the yapfignore.
