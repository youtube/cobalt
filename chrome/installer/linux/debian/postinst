# On Ubuntu 12.04, we have the following priorities
# (which can be obtain be installing browsers and running
# update-alternatives --query x-www-browser):
#
# /usr/bin/epiphany-browser  85
# /usr/bin/firefox           40
# /usr/bin/konqueror         30
#
# While we would expect these values to be keyed off the most popular
# browser (Firefox), in practice, we treat Epiphany as the lower bound,
# resulting in the following scheme:

CHANNEL=@@CHANNEL@@

    # Almost good enough to be the default. (Firefox stable should arguably be
    # higher than this, but since that's below the "Epiphany threshold", we're
    # not setting our priority below it. Anyone want to poke Firefox to raise
    # their priority?)
