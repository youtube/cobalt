This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] clamp int32 1D tensor
  assert_true: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test clamp int32 actual 2147483647 should be close enough to expected 2147483645 by the acceptable 0 ULP distance, but they have 2 ULP distance expected true got false
[FAIL] clamp uint32 1D tensor
  assert_true: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test clamp uint32 actual 4294967295 should be close enough to expected 4294967290 by the acceptable 0 ULP distance, but they have 5 ULP distance expected true got false
[FAIL] clamp int64 1D tensor
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'clamp' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int64 for argument input, must be one of [float32, float16, int32, uint32, int8, uint8]."
