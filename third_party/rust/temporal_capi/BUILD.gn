# v8 depends on temporal_capi, which may occasionally update in ways that
# change its API. Since temporal_capi lives in the chromium repo, v8 cannot
# be atomically upgraded alongside temporal_capi changes. Instead, we have some
# defines here that let v8 detect which version of temporal_capi is vendored.
#
# In case we are vendoring multiple versions of temporal_capi, it is acceptable
# for this array to contain multiple defines.
#
# It is not mandatory to update this array every time temporal_capi updates; it
# is just a convenient tool to use as needed.
