Grandparented-in when setting up `cargo vet` in Jan 2024

Bumped up the exemption to 2.7.1 when updating the crates.  When removing
the exemptions in the future we may want to look at the notes in cl/568617493
but even with those notes a review of the whole crate (rather than just the
delta) may be needed for `ub-risk-2`.

Bumped up the exemption to 2.7.2 in April 2024.  The delta was relatively small
and straightfoward (focusing on `target_feature = \"simd128\"`).  Note that an
unfinished audit of 2.7.1 has been started at https://crrev.com/c/5367005 and
I hear that Fuchsia has also been working on reviewing 2.7.1 (so we should check
later if maybe we can just import their audit).

Bumped up the exemption to 2.7.4 in June 2024, with a small and benign delta.
