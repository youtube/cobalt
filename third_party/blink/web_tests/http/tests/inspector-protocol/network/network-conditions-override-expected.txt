Tests that Network emulation commands correctly handle various override scenarios.


--- Testing command: Network.emulateNetworkConditions ---
Capturing initial state...

Applying full override with valid values...
Verifying state after full override:
  rtt is within expected range [2000, 3000]? true
  effectiveType is slow-2g
  downlink is constrained (<= 5)? true

Applying partial override with downloadThroughput = -1...
Verifying state after partial override with -1:
  rtt is 200
  effectiveType is 4g
  downlink is un-constrained (> 5)? true

Applying partial override with downloadThroughput = 0...
Verifying state after partial override with 0:
  rtt is within expected range [200, 400]? true
  effectiveType is 3g
  downlink is 0

Disabling all overrides to reset to initial state...

Final state matches initial state? true
