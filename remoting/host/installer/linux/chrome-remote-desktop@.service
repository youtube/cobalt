PAMName=chrome-remote-desktop
# Ideally, PAM_TTY would be set to the X display for x11 sessions, but we don't
# yet know what display we'll be using. Leaving it unset has been known to break
# some PAM modules (the pam_systemd documentation explicitly calls out pam_time
# and pam_access, though they appear to have since been fixed) so the below sets
# it to a dummy value. There is some precedence for this, as SSH and cron set
# PAM_TTY to "ssh" and "cron" (respectively) for similar reasons. This also has
# the side effect of making CRD sessions easy to spot in the output of
# loginctl.
#
# Unfortunately, systemd doesn't provide a way to set PAM_TTY explicitly, but it
# will set it to the value of TTYPath, if present. TTYPath must be an absolute
# path, but /dev/ will get stripped off by pam_systemd when it copies the value
# from PAM_TTY to the logind session information. Setting this to a nonexistent
# path seems not to cause issues and long as none of the Standard*= options are
# set to "tty".
