/**
 * Facility is a {@link ConditionalState} scoped to a single host {@link Station} instance.
 *
 * <p>This should be used for example for popup dialogs, menus, temporary messages. A transit-layer
 * class should be derived from it and instantiated. It should expose facility-specific methods for
 * the test-layer to use.
 *
 * <p>As a {@link ConditionalState}, it has a defined lifecycle and must declare {@link Elements}
 * that determine its enter and exit {@link Condition}s.
 *
 * <p>Leaving the host {@link Station} causes this state to be left as well, and exit {@link
 * Condition}s will be waited upon for the {@link Trip} to be complete.
 *
 * <p>Transitions into and out of a Facility while the host {@link Station} is ACTIVE should be done
 * with {@link Station#enterFacilitySync(Facility, Trigger)} and {@link
 * Station#exitFacilitySync(Facility, Trigger)}.
 *
 * @param <HostStationT> the type of host {@link Station} this is scoped to.
