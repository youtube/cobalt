// out-of-order and need to be reordered efficiently for consumption. The
// implementation relies on an assumption that sequence gaps are common but tend
// to be small and short-lived. As such, a SequencedQueue retains at least

// SequenceNumber (exclusive) and the highest queued (or anticipated)
// SequenceNumber so far (inclusive).

// Storage may be sparsely populated at times, but as elements are consumed from
// the queue, storage is compacted to reduce waste.

// ElementTraits may be overridden to attribute a measurable size to each stored
// element. SequencedQueue performs additional accounting to efficiently track

    // Conceptually we treat the active range of entries as a series of
    // contiguous spans:
    //
    //     `entries_`: [2][ ][4][5][6][ ][8][9]
    //
    // For example, above we can designate three contiguous spans: element 2
    // stands alone at the front of the queue, elements 4-6 form a second span,
    // and then elements 8-9 form the third. Elements 3 and 7 are absent.
    //
    // We're interested in knowing how many elements (and their total size, as
    // designated by ElementTraits) are available right now, which means we want
    // to answer the question: how long is the span starting at element 0? In
    // this case since element 2 stands alone at the front of the queue, the
    // answer is 1. There's 1 element available right now.
    //
    // If we pop element 2 off the queue, it then becomes:
    //
    //     `entries_`: [ ][4][5][6][ ][8][9]
    //
    // The head of the queue is pointing at the empty slot for element 3, and
    // because no span starts in element 0 there are now 0 elements available to
    // pop.
    //
    // Finally if we then push element 3, the queue looks like this:
    //
    //     `entries_`: [3][4][5][6][ ][8][9]
    //
    // and now there are 4 elements available to pop. Element 0 begins the span
    // of elements 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    //
    // To answer the question efficiently though, each entry records some
    // metadata about the span in which it resides. This information is not kept
    // up-to-date for all entries, but we maintain the invariant that the first
    // and last element of each distinct span has accurate metadata; and as a
    // consequence if any span starts at element 0, then we know element 0's
    // metadata accurately answers our general questions about the head of the
    // queue.
    //
    // When an element with sequence number N is inserted into the queue, it can
    // be classified in one of four ways:
    //
    //    (1) it stands alone with no element present at N-1 or N+1
    //    (2) it follows an element at N-1, but N+1 is empty
    //    (3) it precedes an element at N+1, but N-1 is empty
    //    (4) it falls between present elements at both N-1 and N+1.
    //
    // In case (1) we record in the entry that its span starts and ends at
    // element N; we also record the length of the span (1) and a traits-defined
    // accounting of the element's "size". This entry now has trivially correct
    // metadata about its containing span, which consists only of the entry
    // itself.
    //
    // In case (2), element N is now the tail of a pre-existing span. Because
    // tail elements are always up-to-date, we simply copy and augment the data
    // from the old tail (element N-1) into the new tail (element N). From this
    // data we also know where the head of the span is, and the head entry is
    // also updated to reflect the same new metadata.
    //
    // Case (3) is similar to case (2). Element N is now the head of a
    // pre-existing span, so we copy and augment the already up-to-date N+1
    // entry's metadata (the old head) into our new entry as well as the span's
    // tail entry.
    //
    // Case (4) is joining two pre-existing spans. In this case element N
    // fetches the span's start from element N-1 (the tail of the span to the
    // left), and the span's end from element N+1 (the head of the span to the
    // right); and it sums their element and byte counts with its own. This new
    // combined metadata is copied into both the head of the left span and the
    // tail of the right span, and with element N populated this now constitutes
    // a single combined span with accurate metadata in its head and tail
    // entries.
    //
    // Finally, the only other operation that matters for this accounting is
    // Pop(). All Pop() needs to do is derive new metadata for the new
