This page tests that the SVG tabbing order is respected properly.

To test, put focus in "a". Pressing Tab should focus "a" through "k" in order, and pressing Shift-Tab should reverse the order.

Tabbing forward....

<rect id="h" tabindex="6"> focused
<rect id="i" tabindex="0"> focused
<rect id="j" tabindex="0"> focused
<rect id="k" tabindex="0"> focused
<rect id="a" tabindex="1"> focused
<rect id="b" tabindex="1"> focused
<rect id="c" tabindex="1"> focused
<rect id="d" tabindex="1"> focused
<rect id="e" tabindex="3"> focused
<rect id="f" tabindex="4"> focused
<rect id="g" tabindex="6"> focused

Tabbing backward....

<rect id="f" tabindex="4"> focused
<rect id="e" tabindex="3"> focused
<rect id="d" tabindex="1"> focused
<rect id="c" tabindex="1"> focused
<rect id="b" tabindex="1"> focused
<rect id="a" tabindex="1"> focused
<rect id="k" tabindex="0"> focused
<rect id="j" tabindex="0"> focused
<rect id="i" tabindex="0"> focused
