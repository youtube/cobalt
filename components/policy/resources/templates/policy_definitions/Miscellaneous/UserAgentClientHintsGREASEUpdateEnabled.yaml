caption: Control the User-Agent Client Hints GREASE Update feature.
default: true
deprecated: true
desc: |-
   This policy is deprecated as the updated GREASE algorithm has been on by default since M103.
   When enabled the User-Agent Client Hints GREASE Update feature aligns the User-Agent GREASE algorithm with the latest spec.
        The updated spec may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain. See the spec for more information: https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#grease
        This policy will be removed in a future release.
