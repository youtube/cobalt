# WebView Tools

This folder includes various tools for testing or developing WebView. This code
**should not** be included in the WebView product itself.

To learn more about python scripts: run the script with the `--help` command.
This should provide basic documentation for what the script does and how to use
it. You may also be able to find additional usage documentation for some scripts
on the subpages of [WebView Docs](/android_webview/docs/README.md).

To learn more about the System WebView Shell Android app: please read [the usage
documentation](/android_webview/docs/webview-shell.md).
