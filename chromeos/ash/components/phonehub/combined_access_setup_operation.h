// (1) Creating a connection to the phone if one does not already exist.
// (2) Sending a message to the phone which asks it to begin the setup flow;
//     upon receipt of the message, the phone displays a UI which asks the
//     user to enable permissions for the Phone Hub features that need setup.
// (3) Waiting for the user to complete the flow; once the flow is complete, the
//     phone sends a message back to this device which indicates that permission
//     has been granted.
//
// If an instance of this class exists, the flow continues until the status
// changes to a "final" status (i.e., a success or a fatal error). To cancel the
// ongoing setup operation, simply delete the instance of this class.
