default: null
desc: "This policy enables or disables the Battery Saver Mode setting.\n\
  \      On Chrome, this setting makes it so that frame rate is throttled to\
  \ lower power consumption. If this policy is unset, the end user can control\
  \ this setting in chrome://settings/performance.\n\
  \      On ChromeOS, this setting makes it so that frame rate and CPU\
  \ frequency are throttled, backlights are dimmed, and Android is put in\
  \ Battery Saver Mode. On devices with multiple CPUs, some CPUs will be turned\
  \ off.\n\
  \      The different levels are:\n\
  \      <ph name=\"BATTERY_SAVER_MODE_DISABLED\">Disabled</ph>\
  \ (0): Battery Saver Mode will be disabled.\n\
  \      <ph name=\"BATTERY_SAVER_MODE_ENABLED_BELOW_THRESHOLD\">EnabledBelowThreshold</ph>\
  \ (1): Battery Saver Mode will be enabled when the device is on battery power\
  \ and battery level is low.\n\
  \      <ph name=\"BATTERY_SAVER_MODE_ENABLED_ON_BATTERY\">EnabledOnBattery</ph>\
  \ (2): This value is deprecated as of M121. From M121 onwards, values will be\
  \      treated as EnabledBelowThreshold.\n      "
