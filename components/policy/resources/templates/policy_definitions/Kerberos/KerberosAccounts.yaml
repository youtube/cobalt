caption: Configure Kerberos accounts
desc: |-
  Adds prefilled Kerberos accounts. If the Kerberos credentials match the login credentials, an account can be configured to reuse the login credentials by specifying '<ph name="LOGIN_EMAIL_PLACEHOLDER">${LOGIN_EMAIL}</ph>' and <ph name="PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER">${PASSWORD}</ph>' for principal and password, respectively, so that the Kerberos ticket can be retrieved automatically, unless two-factor authentication is configured. Users cannot modify accounts added via this policy.

            If this policy is enabled, the list of accounts defined by the policy is added to the Kerberos Accounts settings.

            If this policy is disabled or not set, no accounts are added to the Kerberos Accounts settings and all accounts previously added with this policy are removed. Users may still add accounts manually if the 'Users can add Kerberos accounts' policy is enabled.
