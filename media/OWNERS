# NOTE: Do not use these owners when you're in a subdirectory that has
# OWNERS file. For example:
# - cast
# - midi
# - ozone
# - capture/{content,video}
# Instead prefer the OWNERS in the subdirectory as they will be more familiar,
# and to load balance. Only use OWNERS in this file for these subdirectories
# when doing refactorings and general cleanups.
