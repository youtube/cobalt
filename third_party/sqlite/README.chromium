Chromium maintains a mirror of the official SQLite Git repository at
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/deps/sqlite. Generally the stock
upstream release branch is used, but occasionally unreleased upstream bug
fixes are backported to the release branch.

The official upstream SQLite Git mirror is at https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite.
