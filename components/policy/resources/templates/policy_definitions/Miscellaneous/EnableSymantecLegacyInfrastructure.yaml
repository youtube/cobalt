caption: Enable trust in Symantec Corporation's Legacy PKI Infrastructure
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  When this setting is enabled, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> allows certificates issued by Symantec Corporation's Legacy PKI operations to be trusted if they otherwise successfully validate and chain to a recognized CA certificate.

        Note that this policy depends on the operating system still recognizing certificates from Symantec's legacy infrastructure. If an OS update changes the OS handling of such certificates, this policy no longer has effect.  Further, this policy is intended as a temporary workaround to give enterprises more time to transition away from legacy Symantec certificates.  This policy will be removed on or around January 1st 2019.

        If this policy is not set, or it is set to false, then <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> follows the publicly announced deprecation schedule.

        See https://g.co/chrome/symantecpkicerts for more details on this deprecation.
