// these priorities mean, if they mean anything at all, is also
// platform-specific.

// on a given platform. The only guarantee is that each lower priority should be
// treated less-than-or-equal-to a higher priority.

  // threads run in relation to each other. But exactly how being real-time
  // affects the thread scheduling is platform-specific.
