    This is the ratio (Lag_with_prediction)/(Lag_without_prediction). Lag is the

    scrolling.

    0% means all the lag existing before prediction was removed. 100% means that

    more lag.

    This metric doesn't distinguish between OverPrediction and UnderPrediction.

    Improvement of prediction in touch lag. It is defined as
    (Lag_without_prediction - Lag_with_prediction).

    Lag is the distance between the finger position and the rendered position.

    When positive, prediction improves touch performance (reduces lag). When
    negative, prediction worsens touch performance (increases lag).

    The duration of the interaction/interval is either 1s, or the time from when
    the user starts scrolling to lifting the finger, whichever is smaller.

    This metric uses directionless distances, therefore it doesn't distinguish
    between OverPrediction and UnderPrediction. A same absolute value of
    OverPrediction or UnderPrediction will result in the same PredictionImpact
    value.
