This app is primarily intended to be used for the manual testing of the apps on
the Chrome OS sign-in screen. The sources are located under the ./app/
directory.

The ./app_signed_by_webstore.crx package must be a file signed by WebStore, in
order for the app to have the expected ID which is allowlisted in Chrome -
"bjaiihebfngildkcjkjckolinodhliff".

In case a new version of the test app has to be published on WebStore, please
reach out to the managed-devices@ mailing list.
