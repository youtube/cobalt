This library is included only to allow external users of the Native Client SDK
to build PPAPI plugins using the pthreads interface. This is convenient during
the process of developing or porting a Native Client application.

This library is not shipped with Chromium.

Description:
From https://www.sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/

The POSIX 1003.1-2001 standard defines an application programming interface
(API) for writing multithreaded applications. This interface is known more
commonly as pthreads. A good number of modern operating systems include a
threading library of some kind: Solaris (UI) threads, Win32 threads, DCE
threads, DECthreads, or any of the draft revisions of the pthreads standard.
The trend is that most of these systems are slowly adopting the pthreads
standard API, with application developers following suit to reduce porting
woes.

Win32 does not, and is unlikely to ever, support pthreads natively. This
project seeks to provide a freely available and high-quality solution to this
problem.

Local Modifications:
* Removed execute permissions on some source files.
