// managers have installed a web app allows for them to be installed by multiple
// managers at the same time, and uninstalls from one manager doesn't affect
// another - the app will stay installed as long as at least one management
// source has it installed.

// This enum is also used to rank installation sources, so the ordering matters.
// This enum should be zero based: values are used as index in a bitset.
// We don't use this enum values in prefs or metrics: enumerators can be
// reordered. This enum is not a strongly typed enum class: it supports implicit
// conversion to int and <> comparison operators.
