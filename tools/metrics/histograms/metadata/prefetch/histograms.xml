    When a navigation started, `PrefetchMatchResolver` collects potentially
    matching prefetches for it. Judging a prefetch actually matches or not needs
    non-redirect header. If a prefetch has non-redirect header and actually
    matched, then this process ends synchronously. If not, it waits non-redirect
    headers until it finds a matched and servable one or there is no more
    candidates.

    This histogram records that duration navigation was blocked by the prefetch
    matching, when the matching is settled. Zero is recorded when the navigation
    is not blocked.

  <summary>
    Records the time delta between a missed prefetch matching and a subsequent
    prefetch for the same resource. This is logged when a prefetch request is
    sent to the network for a URL that was recently navigated to by the user and
    that could have been served by the prefetch if it had been available. A
    smaller time delta indicates a potential race condition between the
    navigation and the prefetch. This metric is logged in milliseconds and is
    only recorded against the latest navigation that could've matched with the
    prefetch.

    Note that this is calculated from non-SW-controlled `PrefetchMatchResolver`
    i.e. it is calculated for each redirect, and it ignores SW-controlled
    `PrefetchMatchResolver` case. Also, this information of being unmatched is
    stored in an LRU with a limited size, so older mismatches might not be taken
    into account. Please see
    `PrefetchService::recent_unmatched_navigated_keys_for_metrics_` for more

    Cross-Origin prefetches are made in an isolated network context. When the

    network context used for a prefetch to the user's default network context
    after a prefetched link is navigated to. Note this does not include the time
    it takes to read the cookies from the isolated network context.
