caption: The maximum size, in bytes, that can be transferred between client and host
  via clipboard synchronization
default: null
desc: |-
  If this policy is set, clipboard data sent to and from the host will be truncated to the limit set by this policy.

            If a value of 0 is set, then clipboard sync is disabled.

            This policy affects both remote access and remote support scenarios.

            This policy has no effect if it is not set.

            Setting the policy to a value that is not within the min/max range may prevent the host from starting.

            Please note that the actual upper bound for the clipboard size is based on the maximum WebRTC data channel message size which this policy does not control.
