  assert_true: polygon(evenodd, -10px, -20px, -30px, -40px, -50px, -60px) margin-box doesn't seem to be supported in the computed style expected true got false
[FAIL] Property polygon(10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%) content-box value 'undefined'
  assert_true: polygon(10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%) content-box doesn't seem to be supported in the computed style expected true got false
[FAIL] Property polygon(calc(10px - 0.5em), 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, calc(10px - 0.5em)) value 'polygon(-10px, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, -10px)'
