caption: Per-App Time Limits Allowlist
desc: "This policy specifies which applications and URLs should be allowed for per-app\
  \ usage restrictions.\n        The configured allowlist is applied to the apps installed\
  \ on <ph name=\"PRODUCT_OS_NAME\">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> for the given\
  \ user with per-app time limits.\n        The configured allowlist can only be applied\
  \ to child user accounts and take effect when <ph name=\"PER_APP_TIME_LIMITS_POLICY_NAME\"\
  >PerAppTimeLimits</ph> policy is set.\n        The configured allowlist is applied\
  \ to applications and URLs so that they will not be blocked by per-app time limits.\n\
  \        Accessing allowed URLs will not count towards the chrome time limit.\n\
  \        Add url regular expressions to |url_list| to allow urls that match any\
  \ of the regular expressions in the list.\n        Add an application with its |app_id|\
  \ and |app_type| to |app_list| to allow the application.\n       "
