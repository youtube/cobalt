// Provides functions to validate that the variations seed is
// correctly configured to respect an entropy limit. See below for details.
//
// This limit only applies to field trials configured to use the "limited
// entropy" layer â€“ that is, a layer with `EntropyMode.LIMITED`. For brevity,
// documentation in this file will refer to this layer as the "limited layer".
// There is at most one limited layer in the seed with filters that are
// applicable to the client. For now, it's the server's responsibility to ensure
// this invariant. As an optimization, the client code should be updated to
// consider the filters when calculating entropy (TODO(b/319681288)).
//
// Consider each client's chosen groups across all studies which use limited
// entropy. While some group combinations may be more likely than others (based
// on group percentages), the combination with the minimum probability must have
// a probability above an entropy limit we define (see below). For brevity,
// documentation in this file will refer to information revealed by these chosen
// groups as "entropy".
//
// The entropy limit defined here is analogous to the "low entropy source" used
// elsewhere in the variations codebase, but uses a different implementation
// approach to achieve the result of limiting the total entropy.
//
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory) for more
// information about "entropy" as a mathematical concept.
