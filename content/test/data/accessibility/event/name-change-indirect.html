<!--
Due to a bug in Windows (fixed in Windows 10 19H1), events are raised
exactly twice for any in-proc off-thread event listeners.
AccessibilityEventRecorderUia will try to filter duplicate events, but the
name of the heading item changes so depending on when the superfluous event
is received it may not be filtered out.
Denying the structure change events since this test is mainly testing the
Name changed.
