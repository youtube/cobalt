Description:
Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses the
code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard library to
determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.

Local Modifications:
Removed 'doc' and 'test' directories to reduce total file size.
