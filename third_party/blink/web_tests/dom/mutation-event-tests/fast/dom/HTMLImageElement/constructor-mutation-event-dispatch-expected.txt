CONSOLE WARNING: Listener added for a synchronous 'DOMSubtreeModified' DOM Mutation Event. This event type is deprecated (https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#legacy-event-types) and work is underway to remove it from this browser. Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a risk of future incompatibility. Consider using MutationObserver instead.
Test for http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12353 REGRESSION: Crash on load (mutation event dispatch under the image element constructor deletes the element).

No crash means test PASS.
