/// - the type must have no internal padding
/// - `std::mem::align_of::<T>() == 1`
/// - for structs, the type is `repr(packed)` and `repr(C)`, and all fields are
///   also `FromBytes`

/// In practice, this trait is only implemented for `u8`, `BigEndian<T>`,
/// and for structs where all fields are those base types.
