Description:
BRLTTY is a background process (daemon) which provides access to the Linux/Unix
console (when in text mode) for a blind person using a refreshable braille
display. It drives the braille display, and provides complete screen review
functionality. Some speech capability has also been incorporated.

BRLTTY is used in Chrome OS to provide braille output for the ChromeVox screen
reader. ChromeVox communicates with BRLTTY using libbrlapi, the public client
api.

The libbrlapi.h header is imported because we need to keep it in sync with the
libbrlapi so in Chrome OS.
