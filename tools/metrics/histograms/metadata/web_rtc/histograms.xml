    Measures the duration of each audio interruption event. An audio
    interruption is defined as a loss concealment (a.k.a. expand) event that
    lasts more than 150 milliseconds. The metric registers each of these events.
    This gives an indication of the length and prevalence of severe network

  <summary>
    Logs the AudioMixer source count whenever the mixer gets a new highest
    source count. This allows us to differentiate the histogram to get the
    number of mixers that have had a specific number of maximum sources. For
    example, the number of AudioMixers that have had a maximum of 5 sources is
    NewHighestSourceCount[5] - NewHighestSourceCount[6].

    Note that this is not the same as logging the source count whenever a source
    is added; logging only happens when the source count exceeds the previously

    Measures the duration of each packet loss concealment (a.k.a. expand) event
    that is not followed by a merge operation. The outage is measured in
