    When the user focuses or types into the omnibox, the dropdown results can be
    updated multiple times per input (i.e. when focused, per char typed,
    backspace, etc).

    Specifically, the set of events that trigger dropdown updates are:

    - synchronous suggestions

    - asynchronous suggestions. Can trigger multiple times per input. These are
    often generated on different threads.

    - expiring copied matches

    - interruptions e.g. additional user input changes or closing the dropdown

    A sample flow looks like:

    1) User types a character.

    2) 10ms later, update results with synchronous suggestions.

    3) 50ms later, update results with some asynchronous suggestions.

    4) 50ms later, update results with more asynchronous suggestions.

    5) 400ms later, update results by removing copied matches from the previous
    input.

    6) 50 later, update results with the last batch of asynchronous suggestions.

    The 'Provider.*' slices measure the time between the input change and the
    last async update of that provider is done or interrupted. Includes async
    updates that have no user visible change (i.e. that do not produce async
    matches or produce only async matches that get deduped, culled, or are the
    same as the existing match in its position). Only logged for asynchronous
    providers. Emitted exactly once per input per asynchronous provider;

    The time `AutocompleteController::UpdateResult()` took.

    That method is invoked, and this histogram is recorded: a) Once for the sync
    autocomplete update that occurs when the omnibox input changes (e.g. the
    user types a character, pastes text, focuses the omnibox, etc). b) Once for
    each async autocomplete update that occurs asyncly after the omnibox input
    changes and the various async providers complete. Usually occurs up to 3
    times per input change. But can be less if the updates are interrupted (e.g.
    the popup is closed or input changed again) or include no new suggestions.
    c) Once when copied matches from the previous autocomplete pass expire. This
    happens at most once per input change, but may not occur if all providers
    complete or the input changes prior to the expiration.

    Because this encompasses both sync and async omnibox updates, and the number
    of async updates per sync update is not fixed, it's not a good
    representative of how a feature effects user experienced latency. E.g., a
    feature that makes users type slower will bias this metric towards async
    updates. Besides, this is only a small segment of the user experienced
    latency. This is only intended to measure changes in the actual
    implementation of `UpdateResult()`.

    {Slice}

    This metric uses SCOPED_UMA_HISTOGRAM_TIMER_MICROS so clients without
    high-resolution clocks will either a) be dropped, b) report 0 for very short
    times, or c) be recorded as expected (depending on which comments you

  <summary>
    Records the time taken between a keystroke being typed in the omnibox and
    the text being painted. If there are multiple keystrokes before a paint,
    logs the time since the earliest one.

    This duration is composed of three parts:

    a) the time spent processing the initial input event

    b) the time spent for the repaint task to be scheduled on the message loop

    c) the time spent painting the Omnibox

    d) (on views platforms) the time until the pixels are actually composited

    There's a number of breakdown metrics to help diagnose a regression. First,
    Omnibox.CharTypedToRepaintLatency.ToPaint measures the combined time of (a)
    and (b). Omnibox.QueryTime2 is a good proxy for just (a). And there's also
    Omnibox.PaintTime that corresponds to (c). We don't have a direct metric for
    (d), but if neither Omnibox.CharTypedToRepaintLatency.ToPaint nor
    Omnibox.PaintTime regressed, then the regression must be in (d).

    Note: The semantics of this metric on views platforms changed in M62, as
    previously time (d) was not included in the metric.

    A refinement of Omnibox.CharTypedToRepaintLatency metric. It measures the
    time between the first character insertion in a series that happen during a
    frame, to the time the compositor reports the text was rendered on-screen.
    Compositor-provided timestamps are used for this version of the metric, so
    it is expected to be more accurate: the baseline CharTypedToRepaintLatency
    uses now() from when the subsequent has-processed notification arrives back
    on the UI thread, which may overestimate user-visible latency.

    Note: Compositor-provided timestamps are taken using presentation time
    callbacks. Before M110 the callbacks used for this histogram might be called
    even if the next submitted frame fails to present which means that the
    character is not really rendered on-screen yet. From M110 onward, this is
    fixed by using callbacks that are only called after the first following
    successful presentation, so a slight change might be noticed in the

    Recorded every time the omnibox is focussed and recent content from the

    estimate: the last time Chrome observed a clipboard modification, which is
    certainly older than the current clipboard. If Chrome never observed a

  <summary>
    Recorded every time the omnibox is focussed and a recent content from the
    user's clipboard is suggested. The number emitted is the number of times the
    clipboard content has been suggested within the same session including the
    current time. Thus, the third time it is shown, we'll emit a three to this
    histogram, and this histogram will have previously seen emits of one and
    two. If the clipboard content was the same during a previous run of Chrome
    and this clipboard content was suggested during that run, those impressions
    are not counted. Also, if the clipboard content changes during a particular
    run of Chrome to other content, the omnibox is focused and that clipboard
    content is suggested, then content changes back and Chrome starts suggesting
    the older clipboard content again, the counts start again from scratch.
    Chrome only remembers the number of times the clipboard content was shown
    consecutively.

    This value is useful to compare with the number of times a clipboard
    suggestion has been shown when it is clicked. This value can be obtained
    from OmniboxEvent records in which the selected suggestion is from Clipboard
    provider. In those cases, look in the Clipboard provider's ProviderInfo
    field for |times_returned_results_in_session|. Note that at the time of this
    writing that OmniboxEvent logs aren't recorded in incognito whereas
    histograms are. Thus, the total counts will not be comparable, though the
    distributions should be.

    Recorded every time the omnibox is focussed and a recent content from the

    was shown (which would appear above the clipboard suggestion) or was absent
    (which ought to only happen when the omnibox is empty / the user is on the
    NTP).

    On Android, the total count for this histogram can be usefully compared with
    the count of the user action FocusLocation in order to determine the rate at
    which a clipboard suggestion is shown in the omnibox. To determine the same
    rate on iOS, one needs to compare this histogram's count with the sum of the
    user actions MobileFocusedOmniboxOnNtp, MobileFocusedFakeboxOnNtp, and
    MobileFocusedOmniboxNotOnNtp.

    Furthermore, on either platform, this histogram's count can be usefully
    compared with the count in the clipboard bucket of the
    Omnibox.SuggestionUsed.Provider histogram to determine the clickthrough rate
    on these suggestions.

    converted to fuzzy provider matches for a single omnibox input. This

    This tracks how unstable omnibox matches are.

    Typically, each input change is followed by a single synchronous update, and
    then approximately 3 asynchronous updates. There may be more or less
    asynchronous updates depending on which providers are enabled for the
    particular platform/user, the input (e.g. some providers don't run for
    0-length inputs), and how quickly the input changes occur (e.g. if the
    inputs update rapidly, slower async providers won't have time to provide
    updates before they're aborted by newer inputs).

    For each autocomplete update, this histogram logs whether any match position
    changes. If 1 or more matches changed, logs true once; otherwise false once.

    When the number of matches changes, matches that are removed are considered
    a 'change', while matches that are appended are less disruptive to the user
    and not considered a 'change'. This is because this metric is primarily
    interested in how many times the user could be looking at a match with the
    intention of selecting it, and then it surprisingly goes away.

    Note that merely adding a new provider will increase these counts. That's
    intentional. Swapping matches out annoys users, and to avoid this, we should
    do some things like: caching, update coalescing, update deferral until next
    keystroke, provider timeouts, etc.

    This metric is designed to be normalized by the True count of
    Omnibox.Start.WantAsyncMatches, which will yield the number of match changes
    per keystroke or other user gesture.

    There're the related Omnibox.MatchStability2.InAnyPosition.* slices for
    tracking match instability for all, asynchronous, and synchronous updates.

    This histogram can be considered a boolean analogue to the
    Omnibox.MatchStability2.Index.* histogram which tracks which matches
    changed.

    For each match change, this histogram logs the index of the match change.
    Match changes occur when any match position changes; i.e. is set to a new
    match different from the old match in that position, even if the new match
    was contained in the old matches set. If multiple matches change in a single
    autocomplete update, logs each. If none change in a single autocomplete
    update, this histogram is not logged.

    We primarily care about the default match, which is logged at index 0. All
    indices matter though, so we track the other indices too.

    Logged when the last provider calls `OnProviderUpdate()`. So autocomplete

    won't log this. Likewise, interrupted autocompleted passes (i.e. when the

    Measures the number of sessions for which each type of rich autocompletion

    As the user types into the omnibox, the omnibox suggestions are updated.
    Some of those suggestions may have rich autocompletion. No suggestion may
    have multiple types of rich autocompletion. A type of rich autocompletion is
    considered triggered only if the default suggestion has rich autocompletion.
    If a non-default suggestion has rich autocompletion, does not suffice. If
    any input during the session triggered a rich autocompletion type, that type
    is considered triggered for the entire session.

    Recorded multiple times per omnibox session (i.e. per user selecting a

    triggered during the session (i.e. while the user was typing their input).
    If a rich autocompletion type triggered multiple times during the session

    AutocompleteController - like when we are classifying user text as a Search
    or URL.

    True counts roughly correspond to keystrokes or on-focus events, and can be
    used as a normalizer for per-user-gesture metrics.

    Measures whether the suggestion that was selected by the user offered a tab
    match. A tab match occurs when the URL specified by the suggestion matches
    the URL navigated to by another tab in the browser, within the margin of our

    This metric typically only makes sense with respect to

    Logs the position of &quot;Resume Journey&quot; omnibox actions actually

    This can be combined with Omnibox.ResumeJourneyShown to compute the Usage

    It's safe to compare the total count of this metric to the total count of
    Omnibox.ResumeJourneyShown because within a single popup, only zero or one

    Measures whether the suggestion that was selected by the user offered a tab

    This histogram reports the amount of time it takes to match one set of
    suggestions against all open tabs. This metric is collected once for every
    time a new set of suggestions is received. This includes the Omnibox Focus
    event (when zero-prefix suggestions are offered) and every subsequent key
    stroke, including deletion, backspace etc.

    Each keystroke produces multiple events offering autocomplete matches: a)
    one synchronous, when Start() is called. b) any number of intermediate
    events, depending on whether Providers request the update. c) one at the
    end, when the process completes.

    Since these are produced about 3 times per keystroke, the total time
    consumed per Omnibox interaction is - optimistically -
    3*Omnibox.TypedLength*TabMatchTime. this excludes all the time spent
    formulating the query, such as correcting the input. This metric does not
    express the cumulative time spent matching the tabs (because we do not have
    a metric that counts the number of suggestions the user actually fetched -
    eg. we do not count the number of suggestions received when user pressed the
    backspace key).

    The number of entries in `ShortcutsBackend`'s database that are older than

    This value is expected to be near 0 as there are two mechanisms to delete
    old entries. The first is individual deletions due to notificaitons that the
    associated URL has been deleted from the history system. This mechanism is
    not 100% reliable, however, since the URL deletions are performed by
    HistoryService, which may be started up before ShortcutsBackend, which
    handles the notifications. Therefore the second mechanism is a batch
    deletion of all entries older than 90 days by ShortcutsBackend on profile
    load. The count of deletions via the second mechanism is recorded in
    ShortcutsProvider.OldEntryDeletions.

  <summary>
    The number of entries in `ShortcutsBackend`'s database that were deleted due
    to the associated URL being deleted from the history database. Recorded each
    time an `OnHistoryDeletions` notification from `HistoryService` is received
    by `ShortcutsBackend`.

  <summary>
    The number of entries in `ShortcutsBackend`'s database that were deleted due
    to being older than 90 days. Recorded once on profile load.

    For each profile load, this is expected to record the same value as
    ShortcutsProvider.DatabaseSize.OldEntries. If experimental data appears to
    confirm this, it may not be necessary to maintain both histograms.
