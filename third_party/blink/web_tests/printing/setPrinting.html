<div style="width:798px; height:597px; border:1px solid green;">
  This test case should output 2 pages.<br>
  The default page size is expected to be 800x600, with no margins.
</div>
There should be a blue line above this text.
This line is the boundary of 2 pages.
As the height of green box is shorter than the height of a page by one pixel,
there should be a white line between the green box and the blue line.
