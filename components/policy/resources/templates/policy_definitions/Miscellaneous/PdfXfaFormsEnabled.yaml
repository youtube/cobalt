default: null
desc: |-
  Controls whether the PDF viewer in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> supports XFA forms in PDF documents.

  If this policy is set to True, support for XFA forms is enabled.
  If this policy is set to False, support for XFA forms is disabled.
  If this policy is not set, the default Chrome behavior is used, which may also be influenced by the `#pdf-xfa-forms` flag. When this policy is set, it takes precedence over the `#pdf-xfa-forms` flag.
