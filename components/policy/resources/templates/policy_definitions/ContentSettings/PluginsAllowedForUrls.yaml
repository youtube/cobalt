caption: Allow the <ph name="FLASH_PLUGIN_NAME">Flash</ph> plugin on these sites
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy is deprecated in M88, Flash is no longer supported by Chrome. Setting the policy lets you set a list of URL patterns that specify the sites that can run the <ph name="FLASH_PLUGIN_NAME">Flash</ph> plugin.

        Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="DEFAULT_PLUGINS_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultPluginsSetting</ph> applies for all sites, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

        For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. However, starting in M85, patterns with '*' and '[*.]' wildcards in the host are no longer supported for this policy.
