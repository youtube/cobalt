caption: User avatar image

  This policy allows you to configure the avatar image representing the user on the login screen. The policy is set by specifying the URL from which <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> can download the avatar image and a cryptographic hash used to verify the integrity of the download. The image must be in JPEG format, its size must not exceed 512kB. The URL must be accessible without any authentication.

        The avatar image is downloaded and cached. It will be re-downloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes.

        If this policy is set, <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> will download and use the avatar image.

        If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

        If the policy is left not set, the user can choose the avatar image representing them on the login screen.
