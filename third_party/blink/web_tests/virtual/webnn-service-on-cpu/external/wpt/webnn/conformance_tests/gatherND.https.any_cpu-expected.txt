  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "UnknownError: Failed to execute 'compute' on 'MLContext': Failed to compute: error"
[FAIL] gatherND float32 2D input and 2D negative indices
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': TFLite doesn't support to gather input into one dimension."
