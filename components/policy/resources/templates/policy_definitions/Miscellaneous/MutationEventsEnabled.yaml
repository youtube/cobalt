caption: Re-enable deprecated/removed Mutation Events
deprecated: true
default: false
desc: |-
  This policy provides a temporary opt-back-in to a deprecated and removed set of platform events called Mutation Events.
  When this policy is Enabled, mutation events will continue to be fired, even if they've been disabled by default for normal web users. When this policy is Disabled or unset, these events may not be fired.
  This policy is a temporary workaround, and will be removed in M135.
