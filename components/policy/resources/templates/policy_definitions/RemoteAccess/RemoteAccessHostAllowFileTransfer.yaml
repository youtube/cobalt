caption: Allow remote access users to transfer files to/from the host
default: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset allows users connected to a remote access host to transfer files between the client and the host. This doesn't apply to remote assistance connections, which don't support file transfer.

        Setting the policy to Disabled disallows file transfer.
