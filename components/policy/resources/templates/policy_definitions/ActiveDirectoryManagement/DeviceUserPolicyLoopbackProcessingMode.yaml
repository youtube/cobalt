  Setting the policy specifies whether and how user policy from computer Group Policy Object (GPO) is processed.

  * Default or leaving it unset has user policy read only from user GPOs. Computer GPOs are ignored.

  * Merge will merge user policy in user GPOs with that of computer GPOs. Computer GPOs take precedence.

  * Replace will replace user policy in user GPOs with that of computer GPOs. User GPOs are ignored.
