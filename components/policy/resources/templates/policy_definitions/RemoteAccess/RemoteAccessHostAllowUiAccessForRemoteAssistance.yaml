caption: Allow remote users to interact with elevated windows in remote assistance
  sessions
default: false
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means the remote assistance host runs in a process with <ph name="UIACCESS_PERMISSION_NAME">uiAccess</ph> permissions. This lets remote users interact with elevated windows on the local user's desktop.

        Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means the remote assistance host runs in the user's context, and remote users can't interact with elevated windows on the desktop.
