caption: Allow sites to make requests to local network endpoints.

desc: |-
  List of URL patterns. Requests initiated from websites served by matching origins are not subject to <ph name="LOCAL_NETWORK_ACCESS">Local Network Access</ph> checks.

  If an origin is covered by both this policy and by LocalNetworkAccessBlockedForUrls, LocalNetworkAccessBlockedForUrls takes precedence.

  For origins not covered by the patterns specified here, the user's personal configuration will apply.

  For detailed information on valid URL patterns, please see https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/url-patterns/.

  See https://wicg.github.io/local-network-access/ for <ph
