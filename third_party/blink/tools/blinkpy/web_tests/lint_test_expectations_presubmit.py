# Don't directly or indirectly import blinkpy/web_tests/ports/base.py in this
# script. When running on windows base.py tries to import win32pipe which may
# not be available on machines. Users who call 'git cl upload' run into this
# issue since the command is using python and not vpython. An example bug with
