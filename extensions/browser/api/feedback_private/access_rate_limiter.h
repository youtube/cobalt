// Keeps track of how frequently a resource may be accessed. Uses a rechargeable
// time counter to keep track. Each time an access is attempted, if the counter
// has more than |recharge_period_|, it will be a successful access, and then
// |recharge_period_| is deducted from it. If the counter has less than
// |recharge_period_|, it will not be a successful access.
//
// The counter is automatically charged as time goes on. It is updated based on
// the current time right before each access attempt. The counter maxes out at
// |recharge_period_ * max_num_accesses|.
//
// The counter starts off at the max level, so that at the beginning, the number
// of successful accesses that can be immediately attempted is
// |max_num_accesses|.
//
// For example, suppose max_num_accesses=3 and recharge_period=100 ms. The
// following sequence of events could happen:
// - AttemptAccess() immediately gets called 3 times. It returns true 3 times.
// - Any further access within the next 100 ms will return false.
// - After 100 ms, call AttemptAccess() again. It will return true.
// - Any further access within the next 100 ms will return false.
// - After 200 ms, call AttemptAccess() again. It will return true. It can be
//   called successfully one more time at this point, but we won't call it yet.
// - After 100 ms, call AttemptAccess() twice. It will return true both times,
//   because the meter will have charged enough for two more accessess.
//
// The counter can be charged partially. e.g. it can accrue 50 ms from one
// attempted access and 50 ms from the next, to get a full 100 ms and thus one
// more successful access.
//
// See the unit tests for more info about the behavior.
