        The display-capture permissions-policy gates access to getDisplayMedia(), as per this spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#feature-policy-integration. However, if this policy is Disabled, this requirement is not enforced, and getDisplayMedia() is allowed from contexts that would otherwise be forbidden. This Enterprise policy is temporary; it's intended to be removed after <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 100. It is intended to unblock Enterprise users whose application is non-spec compliant, but needs time to be fixed.

        When enabled or not set, sites can only call getDisplayMedia() from contexts which are allowlisted by the display-capture permissions-policy.

        When disabled, sites can call getDisplayMedia() even from contexts which are not allowlisted by the display-capture permissions policy. Note that other restrictions may still apply.

              Calls are not denied on account of originating from non-allowlisted
              contexts. (Calls may still be denied for other reasons.)
