caption: Power management on the login screen
desc: |-
  Setting the policy lets you set how <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> behaves when there is no user activity for some amount of time while the sign-in screen appears. The policy controls multiple settings. For their individual semantics and value ranges, see the corresponding policies that control power management within a session.

        The deviations from these policies are:

        * The actions to take on idle or lid close cannot be to end the session.

        * The default action taken on idle when running on AC power is to shut down.

        Leaving the policy or any of its settings unset results in the use of the default values for the various power settings.
