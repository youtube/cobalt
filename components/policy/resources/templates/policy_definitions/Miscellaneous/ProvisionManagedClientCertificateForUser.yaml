caption: Enables the provisioning of client certificates for a managed user or profile
desc: |-
  Setting this policy to <ph name="PROVISION_MANAGED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_FOR_USER_ENABLED">Enabled</ph> (value 1) will make the browser request a client certificate from the device management server for a managed user or profile. This certificate will be made available for, e.g., mTLS connections.

  Setting this policy to <ph name="PROVISION_MANAGED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_FOR_USER_DISABLED">Disabled</ph> (value 0) will prevent the browser from requesting the client certificate. If a profile's managed client certificate had already been provisioned, due to this policy being enabled before, it will not be deleted, but it won't be available for mTLS connections and won't be renewed when it expires.
