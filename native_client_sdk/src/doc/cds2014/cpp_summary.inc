Learn the basics of using PPAPI to do 2D graphics from
a C++ program running in Native Client.
Modify our sample to turn fire into water.
Develop inside Google Chrome, using our NaCl Development Environment
Chrome App.
While this codelab currently targets conventional Native Client using our
GCC + GlibC based toolchain, the techniques involved are generally
applicable.

Requirements:
  * An x86 (sorry no arm) Desktop / Laptop
    Windows, macOS, Linux, or Chrome OS browser
    |cpp_check|
  * A fast broadband connection (500MB download)
  * Can read and write C++

.. |cpp_check| raw:: html
