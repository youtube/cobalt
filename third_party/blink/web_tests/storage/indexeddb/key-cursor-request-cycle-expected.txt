Verify that that key cursors weakly hold request, and work if request is GC'd

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Result will be checked later, to ensure that lazy access is safe


otherRequestSuccess():
Verify that the request's result can be accessed lazily:

PASS cursor is non-null.

Ensure request is not released if cursor is still around.
