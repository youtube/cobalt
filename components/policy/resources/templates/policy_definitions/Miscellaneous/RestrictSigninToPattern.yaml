caption: Restrict which Google accounts are allowed to be set as browser primary accounts
  in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>
desc: |-
  Contains a regular expression which is used to determine which Google accounts can be set as browser primary accounts in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> (i.e. the account that is chosen during the Sync opt-in flow).

        An appropriate error is displayed if a user tries to set a browser primary account with a username that does not match this pattern.

        If this policy is left not set or blank, then the user can set any Google account as a browser primary account in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.
