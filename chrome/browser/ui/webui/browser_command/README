This directory contains the Desktop implementations of the browser
commands located at:
//ui/webui/resources/js/browser_command/browser_command.mojom

Add unit tests for every new handled command.

All changes to this directory should be run by //ipc/SECURITY_OWNERS in addition
to the NTP owners in order to ensure the implementations of the promo browser
commands are side-effect-free.
