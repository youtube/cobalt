caption: List of types that should be excluded from synchronization
desc: |-
  If this policy is set all specified data types will be excluded from synchronization both for <ph name="CHROME_SYNC_NAME">Chrome Sync</ph> as well as for roaming profile synchronization. This can be beneficial to reduce the size of the roaming profile or limit the type of data uploaded to the <ph name="CHROME_SYNC_NAME">Chrome Sync</ph> Servers.

        The current data types for this policy are: "apps", "autofill", "bookmarks", "extensions", "preferences", "passwords", "payments", "productComparison", "readingList", "savedTabGroups", "tabs", "themes", "typedUrls", "wifiConfigurations". Those names are case sensitive!

        Notes: Dynamic Policy Refresh is supported only in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 123 and later. Disabling "autofill" also disables "payments". "typedUrls" refers to all browsing history.
