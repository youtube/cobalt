  A policy to control whether the <ph name="PRIVACY_SANDBOX_NAME">Privacy Sandbox</ph> <ph name="IP_PROTECTION_NAME">IP Protection</ph> feature should be enabled.

  <ph name="IP_PROTECTION_NAME">IP Protection</ph> is a feature that limits availability of a user's original IP address for certain third-party network requests made while browsing in Incognito mode, enhancing protections against cross-site tracking during Incognito browsing sessions.

  If the policy is set to Disabled, then <ph name="IP_PROTECTION_NAME">IP Protection</ph> will be disabled and users won't be able to enable the feature via UI settings.
  If the policy is set to Enabled, then <ph name="IP_PROTECTION_NAME">IP Protection</ph> will be enabled and users won't be able to disable the feature via UI settings.
  If the policy is not set, <ph name="IP_PROTECTION_NAME">IP Protection</ph> will be enabled by default and users will be able to control the feature on their device via UI settings.

  Some considerations regarding whether enterprises should disable <ph name="IP_PROTECTION_NAME">IP Protection</ph> include:

  - DNS lookups won't be performed for requests that are proxied, which may impact DNS-based monitoring or filtering.

  - Enterprise applications may experience breakage when used in Incognito mode if they rely on requests to domains (or subdomains of those domains) on the Masked Domain List (<ph name="MASKED_DOMAIN_LIST_URL">$1<ex>https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ip-protection/blob/main/Masked-Domain-List.md</ex></ph>) and require those requests to come from specific IP address ranges.

  - Traffic might not be proxied in Incognito mode under certain conditions, for example when users launch Incognito mode from a Chrome profile they aren't signed in to. In general the feature requires the user to have been signed in to Chrome with a personal Google account when launching Incognito mode.

  - The list of domains on the Masked Domain List may change over time, with new versions being pushed to users automatically. For more information on the Masked Domain List, see: <ph name="MASKED_DOMAIN_LIST_CRITERIA_URL">$1<ex>https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ip-protection/blob/main/README.md#identifying-domains-and-the-masked-domain-list-mdl</ex></ph>.

  <ph name="IP_PROTECTION_NAME">IP Protection</ph> will be launched no sooner than M139.
