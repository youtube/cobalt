This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Async Function constructor is also clipped.
  assert_equals: expected "Function|(a,b\\n) {\\nreturn '12345678901234567890123" but got "eval|(async function anonymous(a,b\\n) {\\nreturn"
[FAIL] Generator Function constructor is also clipped.
  assert_equals: expected "Function|(a,b\\n) {\\nreturn '12345678901234567890123" but got "eval|(function* anonymous(a,b\\n) {\\nreturn '123"
