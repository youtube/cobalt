        rendered the same. However, their difference is important as they would
        be NFC normalized to the same code point, matching the hash. Since NFC
        normalization should not be performed, the second script should not
        match the hash and must not be executed. -->

            This tests Unicode normalization. While appearing the same, the
            strings in the scripts are different Unicode points. Unicode NFC
            normalization would make both match the hash, but normalization
            should not be performed, and so the second script should not run.
