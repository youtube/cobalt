Description:
The ARCore Android SDK provides augmented reality capabilities to Android
devices. This package contains partner version of ARCore SDK client specific
to Chrome. Since the partner version is not published to Maven (see package URL
for more context about dependencies), the .aar file is uploaded to CIPD.

Googler update instructions - see:

Local Modifications:
* Added files required for consumption in Chrome (LICENSE, OWNERS, BUILD.gn,
  cipd.yaml, *.info).
* Extracted AndroidManifest.xml and split into two separate .xml files.
* Added AndroidManifest_0_remove.xml for weblayer use.
* Added override for proguard configs brought by ARCore SDK's .aar.
  * The override should be removed once ARCore SDK includes the change upstream and
    the version of SDK gets rolled.

Changes:
2024-07-30 - Upgraded SDK binaries to v1.44.
2023-09-29 - Upgraded SDK binaries to v1.39.
2023-04-18 - Split AndroidManifest.xml into two separate files.
2022-07-18 - Upgraded SDK binaries to v1.32.
2021-06-23 - Ignoring Manifest changes so we don't include them in WebView.
2021-02-01 - Upgraded SDK binaries to v1.22.
2020-07-13 - Upgraded SDK binaries to v1.18.
2020-01-23 - Added override for proguard configs brought by ARCore SDK's .aar.
             This was achieved by extracting proguard.txt from
             core-partner_chrome-1.10.0.aar and commenting out offending
             lines that would prevent proguard from optimizing unused public
             classes away.
2019-07-01 - Initial version.
