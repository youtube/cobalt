// This test opens a cross-origin popup and then the popup creates an iframe
// that's same-origin with the opener page. In the iframe we create a service
// worker and then the iframe communicates whether it has observed UseCounter
// kThirdPartyServiceWorker. When storage partitioning is disabled, the
// service worker will be shared between the top-level context and the iframe
// (we could have created the service worker here, for instance). When storage
// partitioning is enabled, though, service workers won't be shared between the
// top-level site and the iframe. Therefore, we need to create the service
// worker in the iframe so that a corresponding service worker is present and
// will cause the kThirdPartyServiceWorker UseCounter to be hit.
