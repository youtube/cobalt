// two necessary mojom connections for observing lifecycle events:
// - The `mojo::Remote<crosapi::mojom::TelemetryDiagnosticRoutineObserver>`
// which holds
//   a connection with crosapi. As soon as an event is triggered from
//   cros_healthd, it should be forwarded to this remote.
// - The `mojo::Receiver<cros_healthd::mojom::RoutineObserver>`, which holds
//   a connection with cros_healthd. The `OnRoutineStateChange` method is
//   invoked whenever cros_healthd monitors an event.
//
// The connection is "alive" while both connections with cros_healthd and
// crosapi are open. If one of them is closed, we also close the other open
// connection and this object can be deleted.
