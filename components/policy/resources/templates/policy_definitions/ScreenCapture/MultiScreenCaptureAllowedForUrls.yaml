caption: Enables automatic screencapture of multiple screens
desc: |-
  The <ph name="GET_ALL_SCREENS_MEDIA_NAME">getAllScreensMedia</ph> API allows isolated web applications (identified by their origin) to capture multiple surfaces at once without additional user permission.
        If the policy is not set, <ph name="GET_ALL_SCREENS_MEDIA_NAME">getAllScreensMedia</ph> is not available for any web application.
  In order to improve privacy, this policy will not support mid-session updates of the policy value and therefore changes will only apply after the user logged out and logged in again.
  The user can be sure that no additional apps will be able to capture the screens after login if it were not allowed at session start already.
