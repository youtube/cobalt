  <summary>
    Measures whether the provided HTML language (i.e. the page lang attribute if
    it exists, otherwise the header Content-Language value) matches the language
    determined by the model. Beyond directly matching or mismatching the HTML
    language, the model can complement the HTML language. For example, suppose
    the HTML language is 'zh' (general Chinese), a language code that the
    Translate server does not support. In this case, the model can detect a
    subcode like '-TW' or '-CN', resulting in language codes 'zh-TW' and
    'zh-CN', which the Translate server supports. This is referred to as
    &quot;complementing a language subcode&quot;.

    This histogram is recorded every time language detection is run. This

    Logs an unsupported source language detected during initiation of the
    Translate feature. This is reported when the language detector successfully

    assess how important the unsupported language is for Google translate.
