This directory contains files related to lookalike warnings and safety tips.

If Chrome believes a site a user is visiting is a lookalike URL, Chrome may
warn users about this state. This warning may either be a full-page interstitial
warning or a pop-up while visiting the page.

See docs/security/lookalikes/lookalike-domains.md for details.

## Interstitials

The lookalike interstitial is triggered when a user visits a domain that is
similar to that of a domain of a popular site. See //docs/idn.md for details.

## Safety Tips

Safety Tip warnings are an experiment to warn users when Chrome believes a site
is low reputation, due either to client- or server-side checks. This warning may
either be a full-page interstitial warning or a pop-up while visiting the page.

Both warnings avoid triggering on sites that are likely to be benign, such as
popular sites, or sites with a high site engagement.
