struct BiddingAndAuctionServerKey;

// Handles caching (not yet implemented) and dispatching of trusted bidding and
// scoring signals requests. Only handles requests to Trusted Execution
// Environments (TEEs), i.e., versions 2+ of the protocol, so does not handle
// legacy bring-your-own-server (BYOS) requests. The browser process makes a
// request and gets a Handle and a partition ID, which can then be used to fetch
// the response through the Mojo auction_worklet::mojom::TrustedSignalsCache
// API provided by the Cache. The Handle and partition ID are provided
// immediately on invocation, but the network request may not be sent out
// immediately.
//
// The values it vends are guaranteed to remain valid at least until the Handle
// they were returned with is destroyed. Having the cache in the browser process
// allows requests to be sent while the Javascript process is still starting up,
// and allows the cache to live beyond the shutdown of the often short-live
// Javascript processes.
//
// Internally, it uses 4 maps:
//
// * `fetches_`, a multimap of pending/live Fetches, with FetchKeys consisting
// of what must be the same to share a fetch. On fetch completion, ownership of
// the response is passed to the corresponding CompressionGroupData(s) and the
// Fetch is deleted. See FetchKey for more details on why this is a multimap
// rather than a map.
//
// * `compression_group_data_map_`, a map of UnguessableTokens
// (`compression_group_tokens`) to CompressionGroupData, which contain the still
// compressed response for a single partition group within a fetch. A
// CompressionGroupData may have one or more partitions, each of which
// corresponds to a single [Bidding|Scoring]CacheEntry. The lifetime of
// CompressionGroupData is scoped to the Handle objects returned by the Cache.
//
// * `bidding_cache_entries_`, a map of BiddingCacheEntries, with
// BiddingCacheKeys consisting of what must be the same to share a Fetch, a
// compression group, and partition within the group. Fields that can be merged
// between requests to share a partitiong (e.g., trusted signals keys) are part
// of entry itself, not the key. This is a map, not a multimap, so if a
// BiddingCacheEntry cannot be reused (with or without modification) to suit the
// needs of an incoming request, the BiddingCacheEntry is deleted, and removed
// from its CompressionGroupData. Destroying a BiddingCacheEntry in this way
// will not destroy the CompressionGroupData, or the CompressionGroupData's
// fetch, if it has one.
//
// * TODO(https://crbug.com/333445540): A map of ScoringCacheEntries much akin
// to the map of BiddingCacheEntries.
//
// Fetches and CacheEntries have pointers to the corresponding
// CompressionGroupData, while the CompressionGroupData owns the corresponding
// values in the other two maps. Deleting a CompressionGroupData removes the
// corresponding values in the two maps. One CompressionGroupData may own
// multiple CacheEntries, but will only own one live/pending Fetch. Ownership of
// a Fetch may be shared by multiple CompressionGroupData objects with matching
// FetchKeys.
//
// Each handed out Handle object will keep its corresponding
// CompressionGroupData alive until the handle is destroyed.
//
// TODO(https://crbug.com/333445540): Add caching support. Right now, entries
// are cached only as long as there's something that owns a Handle, but should
// instead cache for at least a short duration as long as an entry's TTL hasn't
// expired. Holding onto a CompressionGroupData reference, which is refcounted,
// is all that's needed to keep an entry alive.
//
// TODO(https://crbug.com/333445540): May need some sort of rate limit and size
// cap. Currently, this class creates an arbitrary number of downloads, and
// potentially stores an unlimited amount of data in browser process memory.
