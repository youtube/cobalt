This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] gru float32 tensors steps=2 with options.bias, options.recurrentBias, options.direction='backward', options.activations=['relu', 'relu'] and options.returnSequence=true
  assert_true: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test gru float32 actual -0.25 should be close enough to expected -0.24974998831748962 by the acceptable 3 ULP distance, but they have 16778 ULP distance expected true got false
[FAIL] gru float32 tensors steps=2 with all options
  assert_true: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test gru float32 actual -0.25 should be close enough to expected -0.24974998831748962 by the acceptable 3 ULP distance, but they have 16778 ULP distance expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
