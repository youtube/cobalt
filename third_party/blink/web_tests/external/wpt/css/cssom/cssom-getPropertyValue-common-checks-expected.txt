This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS All properties can serialize 'initial'
FAIL All properties (except 'all') can serialize their initial value (computed) assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid", "none / none / none / row / auto / auto"], ["grid-template", "none / none / none"], ["page-orientation", ""], ["size", ""]] length 4
FAIL All properties (except 'all') can serialize their initial value (specified) assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid-column-gap", "normal", ""], ["grid-gap", "normal normal", ""], ["grid-row-gap", "normal", ""]] length 3
PASS All shorthands can serialize their longhands set to 'initial'
FAIL All shorthands (except 'all') can serialize their longhands set to their initial value assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["border", ""], ["grid-gap", ""]] length 2
PASS All aliases can serialize target property set to 'initial'
FAIL All aliases can serialize target property set to its initial value assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid-column-gap", ""], ["grid-row-gap", ""]] length 2
PASS Can't serialize shorthand when longhands are set to different css-wide keywords
