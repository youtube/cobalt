caption: Allow merging list policies from different sources
desc: |-
  Setting the policy allows merging of selected policies when they come from different sources, with the same scopes and level.

        Use the wildcard character '*' to allow merging of all list policies.

        If a policy is in the list and there's conflict between sources with:

        * The same scopes and level: The values merge into a new policy list.

        * Different scopes or level: The policy with the highest priority applies.

        If a policy isn't in the list and there's conflict between sources, scopes, or level, the policy with the highest priority applies.
