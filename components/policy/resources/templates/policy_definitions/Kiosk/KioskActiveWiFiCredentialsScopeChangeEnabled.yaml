caption: Expose per-app kiosk active WiFi credentials to the device level
default: false
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> will automatically save the active kiosk WiFi credentials at the device level: the active WiFi can be used by any other kiosk apps or users on the device.
  Leaving this policy unset or setting it to Disabled means kiosk active WiFi credentials are stored at the kiosk level: WiFi configured in a kiosk app can only be used in that same kiosk app.
  This policy is not recommended and has to be used when no other options are available (e.g. OpenNetworkConfiguration policy).
