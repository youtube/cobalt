This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Magnetometer: sensor is suspended and resumed when focus traverses from to cross-origin frame
PASS Magnetometer: sensor is not suspended when focus traverses from to same-origin frame
PASS Magnetometer: losing a document's frame with an active sensor does not crash
PASS Magnetometer: calling start() in a non-fully active document does not crash
