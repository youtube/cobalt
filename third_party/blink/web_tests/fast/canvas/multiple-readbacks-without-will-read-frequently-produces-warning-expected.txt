CONSOLE WARNING: Canvas2D: Multiple readback operations using getImageData are faster with the willReadFrequently attribute set to true. See: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#concept-canvas-will-read-frequently
Verify that reading back from a canvas2D multiple times without using willReadFrequently produces a console warning.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
