# Chromium Codelab

See the `cpp101/` directory for the Chromium C++ codelab,
including example solutions.

See the `threading_and_scheduling/` directory for more elaborate usages of the
threading and scheduling primitives in Chromium.

## Motivation

The goal of this codelab is to introduce new Chromium developers to both the
important design patterns and the style of code they can expect to become
familiar with.

The code in this directory is for documentation purposes only. It is compiled
via the top level BUILD.gn's `gn_all` target to make sure it is kept up to date.
