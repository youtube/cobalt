caption: Allow SMS Messages to be synced from phone to Chromebook.
default_for_enterprise_users: false
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled lets users set up their devices to sync their text messages to Chromebooks. Users must explicitly opt in to this feature by completing a setup flow. On completion, users can send and receive texts on their Chromebooks.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't set up text syncing.

        Leaving the policy unset means that by default, the feature isn't allowed for managed users but is allowed for other users.
