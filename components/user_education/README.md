# User Education

User Education in Chrome is designed to introduce users to new and
existing features with which they might not be familiar.

The user education system provides a common UX for nudging users towards
these features, including full, user-initiated tutorials.

User education experiences should start at the UX design and PRD stage of
feature design, as they are integral parts of any major new feature. UX and PM
should refer to the
[Desktop User Education Homepage](https://sites.google.com/corp/google.com/desktopusereducation/home)
for guidance long before any implementation work begins.

When you are ready to implement your feature's user education journey, begin
with the [Getting Started Guide](/components/user_education/getting-started.md).
