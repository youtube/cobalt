<p>Given a float followed by a regular block with the same height as the float, then a block B with
    a negative margin, followed by a table. Check that the table doesn't overlap with the
    float. There's an empty collapse-through block before B, so that our initial logical top
    estimate fails and we have to relayout. When laying out again, we have to detect that the float
    that we first thought didn't affect the table now affects it.</p>
<p>The word "BINGO" should be seen below, to the right of a blue block.</p>

            <!-- Here's an empty block that we can just collapse through, but we don't realize that
                 when calculating our initial top estimate on its parent, so we have to relayout
                 when it turns out that a negative margin has pulled us upwards (and suddenly we
                 have something block-level that's affected by the float). -->
