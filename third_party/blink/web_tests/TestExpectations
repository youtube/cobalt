# This is the main failure suppression file for Blink LayoutTests.
# Further documentation:
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_test_expectations.md

# Single [ Skip ] expectation is not allowed in this file. Normally we should
# not skip a test because it's failing or flaky. We should add failure or flaky
# expectations instead, so that they will still run on bots, and we can collect
# data about their flakiness and update their expectations accordingly.
#
# For tests that we really want to skip:
# - We can skip tests that we don't want to run in NeverFixTests. Please see
#   the file for other Skip cases.
# - For tests that are only meaningful if run under some virtual suite(s),
#   please use 'exclusive_tests' in VirtualTestSuites.
# - 'Skip' together with other expectations is allowed in this file for now:
#   - [ Skip Timeout ] to skip Timeout tests that are also marked Slow in
#     SlowTests.
#   - (rare and not encouraged) [ Skip OtherExpectation(s) ] to temporarily
#     skip tests that are harmful to the test runner or other tests, or to
#     skip tests for historical reasons.

# Intentional failures to test the layout test system.

# ====== Paint team owned tests from here ======
# The paint team tracks and triages its test failures, and keeping them colocated
# makes tracking much easier.
# Covered directories are:
#  compositing except compositing/animations
#  hittesting
#  images, css3/images,
#  paint
#  svg
#  canvas, fast/canvas
#  transforms
#  display-lock
#  view-transition
# Some additional bugs that are caused by painting problems are also within this section.

# The tests happened to pass with two bugs canceled each other. Now they fail
# with the first bug fixed. Will be fixed when the second bug is fixed (crrev.com/c/3752748).
