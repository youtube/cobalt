Description:
After fetching from Google storage, the data/ folder contains a filter list
derived from EasyList. It is used for the Subresource Filter, as described at
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/subresource_filter/README.md.
This copy is included in WebLayer releases, but is not used for Chrome. Instead,
Chrome's filter list is updated via the component updater. Still, we have set
the Shipped field to yes to ensure the license is included in chrome://credits.

Local Modifications:
The filter list is processed to reduce its size substantially. We include the
unindexed version of this smaller ruleset. The full process is described at
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/subresource_filter/FILTER_LIST_GENERATION.md.
A manifest.json file is added to the top-level directory and is not based on
EasyList. It mirrors the manifest.json file distributed by component updater for
Chrome and lists version information for the derived list.
