[FAIL] Navigator interface: operation finalizeAd(Ads, AuctionAdConfig)
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "finalizeAd" missing
[FAIL] Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "createAdRequest(AdRequestConfig)" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "createAdRequest" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Navigator interface: calling createAdRequest(AdRequestConfig) on navigator with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_inherits: property "createAdRequest" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "finalizeAd(Ads, AuctionAdConfig)" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "finalizeAd" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Navigator interface: calling finalizeAd(Ads, AuctionAdConfig) on navigator with too few arguments must throw TypeError
