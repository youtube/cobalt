caption: Enable IPv6 reachability check override
default: false
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to true overrides the IPv6 reachability check. This means that the
  system will always query AAAA records when resolving host names. It applies to
  all users and interfaces on the device.

  Setting the policy to false or leaving it unset does not overrides the IPv6 reachability check.
  The system only queries AAAA records when it is reachable to a global IPv6 host.
