// - It never starts overlapping snapshots, Client reports when previous
//   snapshot is done.
// - The currently worked on (pending) snapshot is always allowed to complete,
//   the new attempts to start a snapshot are ignored until it does.
// - Some signals prevent more snapshots to be taken.
//   OnLoad is currently such signal.
// - Once Reset() is called on the SnapshotController, the delayed tasks are
//   reset so no StartSnapshot calls is made 'cross-session'.
