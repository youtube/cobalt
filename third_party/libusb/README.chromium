Description:
libusbx provides a platform-agnostic API for accessing the USB subsystem on Mac,
Windows, and Linux systems. All the unused files are removed.

Local Modifications:
- License headers fixed.
- config.h has been created to satisfy includes within the tree.
- Exposing an API (libusb_interrupt_handle_event) to explicitly interrupt
  libusb_handle_event.
- windows-build.patch has been applied.
- darwin-sigfpe.patch has been applied.
- upstream-tick147.patch has been applied.
- linux-udev.patch has been applied.
- composite-hid-close.patch has been applied.
- assign-endpoints-checks.patch has been applied.
- open-fd.patch has been applied.
- Added libusb_get_raw_config_descriptor and libusb_get_active_config_value
  methods to avoid using the built-in parser.
- Removed OSAtomic calls from darwin_usb.c for macOS compatibility by
  backporting and simplifying the 10.12 branch of the upstream
  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libusb/+/1e05092aa98d60c717929629ac16590595e08431
  as the 10.12 branch works fine on all previous OSes.
- cherry-picked upstream 8d7616886e062
