This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setTimeout must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://web-platform.test:8001/html/semantics/scripting-1/the-script-element/module/imports-a.js?label=setTimeout"
PASS direct eval must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute
PASS indirect eval must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute
PASS the Function constructor must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute
PASS reflected inline event handlers must not inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus fail
PASS inline event handlers triggered via UA code must not inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus fail
Harness: the test ran to completion.
