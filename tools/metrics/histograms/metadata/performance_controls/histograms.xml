  <summary>
    Logged on each battery saver mode bubble close indicating whether the bubble
    is dismissed (either by the user or by the system e.g. closed at shutdown)
    or used it to turn off battery saver mode for current session. This will be
    used to measure the efficacy of the bubble message and the number of users
    that interact with the battery saver toolbar button.

  <summary>
    Logged each time the user opens the settings page through the link on the
    battery saver mode IPH. This will be combined with an existing histogram
    measuring the number of times the IPH is open to measure how the user
    responds to it.

    Logs an enum when the performance intervention message is triggered by the
    Performance Detection Manager. The enum represents result of trying to
    trigger the intervention messaging (i.e it was able to be shown or the

  <summary>
    Logs each time the user removes a tab from the suggested tab list in the
    performance intervention dialog. This will log the number of actionable tabs
    after the user removed one from the list. This will be used to learn the
    distribution of number of suggested tabs a user will see.

    Logged each time the user enables memory saver mode through the link on the
    memory saver mode IPH. This will be combined with an existing histogram
    measuring the number of times the IPH is open to measure how the user
    responds to it.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceControls.MemorySaver.SettingsChangeAggressiveness"
    enum="MemorySaverModeAggressiveness" expires_after="2025-05-07">

  <summary>
    Logs whether the user did an add, edit, or remove operation to the tab
    discard exception list for memory saver mode. This will be used to better
