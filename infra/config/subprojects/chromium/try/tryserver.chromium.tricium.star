# This orchestrator differs from traditional orchestrators:
# - we invoke _multiple_ builders which are conceptually compilators
# - these builders exist in various pools with differing platform constraints
# - these builders use standard builder core counts, rather than compilator core
#   counts
# - these builders do not upload build artifacts; they only communicate with
#   this orchestrator via `output` properties.
# Due to these divergences, we roll our own orchestration scheme here.
