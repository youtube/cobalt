// 1. Dismisses any modal view, excluding the omnibox if `dismissOmnibox` is NO,
// 2. (only if `targetMode` is UNDETERMINED) Resolves the value of `targetMode`,
//    potentially by presenting the Incognito interstitial to the user and
//    letting them choose, alternatively by falling back to normal mode if the
//    user did not enable the "Ask to Open Links from Other Apps in Incognito"
//    setting.
// 3. Opens either a normal or incognito tab with `urlLoadParams`,
//    unless it was manually cancelled by the user at step 2.
//
// If `completion` is not nil, it is either called once Incognito interstitial
// has been presented, or once a new tab has been opened.
// After Tab is opened the virtual URL is set to the pending navigation item.
