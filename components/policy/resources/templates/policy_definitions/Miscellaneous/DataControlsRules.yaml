caption: Sets a list of Data Controls rules.
desc: |-
  Configures a list of Data Control rules to prevent data leaks. Data leaks can happen by copying and pasting data, attaching files to web pages, printing, downloading, ...etc.

        Each rule consists of the following:
        - Properties of the source of an action. A rule will only trigger if a user action matches all the fields populated in its <ph name="DATA_CONTROLS_SOURCES">sources</ph> field. For list sub-fields, only one entry needs to be matched, for example only one URL pattern needs to match to trigger the rule.
        - Properties of the destination of an action. A rule will only trigger if a user action matches all the fields populated in its <ph name="DATA_CONTROLS_DESTINATIONS">destinations</ph> field. For list sub-fields, only one entry needs to be matched, for example only one URL pattern needs to match to trigger the rule.
        - A list of restrictions to be applied on the data of the sources.

        Rules can be added to:
        - Control the clipboard data shared between the sources and the destinations.
        - Control printing from any of the sources.
        - Control files being attached to any of the destinations.
        - Control files being downloaded from any of the sources.

        If <ph name="ON_SECURITY_EVENT_ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR">OnSecurityEventEnterpriseConnector</ph> policy is set to True, triggered rules be reported to the admin.
        The restriction level can be set to ALLOW, BLOCK, WARN, REPORT.
        - If the restriction level is set to ALLOW, the action will be allowed. This also overrides restrictions applied by other rules.
        - If the restriction level is set to BLOCK, the action won't be allowed.
        - If the restriction level is set to WARN, a user will be warned and may choose to proceed with or cancel the action.
        - If the restriction level is set to REPORT, the user action will not be interrupted, but a report will be sent if <ph name="ON_SECURITY_EVENT_ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR">OnSecurityEventEnterpriseConnector</ph> policy is enabled.

        Notes:
        - Format the URL patterns according to this format ( https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format ).
        - For data leak prevention rules specific to <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>, see also the <ph name="DATA_LEAK_PREVENTION_RULES_LIST">DataLeakPreventionRulesList</ph> policy.

        If the policy is left not set, no restrictions will be applied.
