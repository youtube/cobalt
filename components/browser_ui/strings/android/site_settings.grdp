As a step towards the ultimate deprecation of third-party cookies, we're first separating them from other forms of 'site data', making it easier to eventually remove this page completely. Cookies are often used for honorable objectives, and the difference between first and third-party cookies is important (see any of the many resources online such as https://termly.io/resources/articles/first-party-cookies-vs-third-party-cookies/.">

For example, you might place a pair of shoes in a shopping cart, close down your browser, and find those same shoes in your shopping cart when you visit the same site a week later. Sometimes that info is saved in the Cloud. Sometimes that info is saved on the user's device. There are several ways a site can save info to the user's deviceâ€”for example, with cookies (text files saved to your device), small JavaScript databases, and even Chrome's new ad settings that are part of the Privacy Sandbox project (see details below). This page introduces the concept of on-device site data, allows the user to see which sites are using it, and allows the user to delete all saved data or just data from specific sites.">

  <message name="IDS_WEBSITE_SETTINGS_SITE_DATA_PAGE_DESCRIPTION" desc="A paragraph that appear beneath the page title: 'On-device site data'. It defines what on-device site data is. What is 'On-device site data'? When you interact with a site, that site can remember things about what you do. For example, you might place a pair of shoes in a shopping cart, close down your browser, and find those same shoes in your shopping cart when you visit the same site a week later. Sometimes that info is saved in the Cloud. Sometimes that info is saved on the user's device. There are several ways a site can save info to the user's deviceâ€”for example, with cookies (text files saved to your device), small JavaScript databases, and even Chrome's new ad settings that are part of the Privacy Sandbox project (see details below). This page introduces the concept of on-device site data, allows the user to see which sites are using it, and allows the user to delete all saved data or just data from specific sites.  **** CONTEXT PRIVACY SANDBOX **** Chromeâ€™s Privacy Sandbox initiative 1) deprecates third-party cookies in Chrome, 2) supports free and open content on the web (by finding better ways to support ads online), 3) while providing stronger privacy protections for users. You can see a high-level description of this public project at www.privacysanbox.com.">
    A site you visit can save info about what youâ€™re doing so that it works as you would expect â€” for example, to keep you signed in to a site or to save items in your shopping cart. Often sites save this info temporarily on your device.
