                accepts, like the hex-encoded SHA1 hash of the certificate. Must

                PKG files. This will be passed as the parameter for the call to
                `productbuild --sign <identity>`. Note that a hex-encoded SHA1
                hash is not a valid option, as it is for |identity| above. The
                common name of the cert will work. If there is any distribution
                that is packaged in a PKG this must not be None.
            notary_user: Optional string username that will be used to
                authenticate to Apple's notary service if notarizing.
            notary_password: Optional string password or password reference
                (e.g. @keychain, see `xcrun altool -h`) that will be used to
                authenticate to Apple's notary service if notarizing.
            notary_asc_provider: Optional string that will be used as the
                `--asc-provider` argument to `xcrun altool`, to be used when
                notary_user is associated with multiple Apple developer teams.
            codesign_requirements_basic: Optional string to specify the default
                basic `codesign --requirements`.
            notary_team_id: String for the Apple Team ID to use when notarizing.
                Mandatory when using the notarytool `notarization_tool`, ignored
                otherwise.
            notarization_tool: The tool to use to communicate with the Apple
                notary service. If None, the config will choose a default.
