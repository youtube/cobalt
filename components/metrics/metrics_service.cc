// Description of a MetricsService instance's life cycle.
//
// OVERVIEW
//
// A MetricsService instance is typically created at application startup.  It is
// the central controller for the acquisition of log data, and the automatic
// transmission of that log data to an external server.  Its major job is to
// manage logs, grouping them for transmission, and transmitting them.  As part
// of its grouping, MS finalizes logs by including some just-in-time gathered
// memory statistics, snapshotting the current stats of numerous histograms,
// closing the logs, translating to protocol buffer format, and compressing the
// results for transmission.  Transmission includes submitting a compressed log
// as data in a URL-post, and retransmitting (or retaining at process
// termination) if the attempted transmission failed.  Retention across process
// terminations is done using the PrefServices facilities. The retained logs
// (the ones that never got transmitted) are compressed and base64-encoded
// before being persisted.
//
// Logs fall into one of two categories: "initial logs," and "ongoing logs."
// There is at most one initial log sent for each complete run of Chrome (from
// startup, to browser shutdown).  An initial log is generally transmitted some
// short time (1 minute?) after startup, and includes stats such as recent crash
// info, the number and types of plugins, etc.  The external server's response
// to the initial log conceptually tells this MS if it should continue
// transmitting logs (during this session). The server response can actually be
// much more detailed, and always includes (at a minimum) how often additional
// ongoing logs should be sent.
//
// After the above initial log, a series of ongoing logs will be transmitted.
// The first ongoing log actually begins to accumulate information stating when
// the MS was first constructed.  Note that even though the initial log is
// commonly sent a full minute after startup, the initial log does not include
// much in the way of user stats.   The most common interlog period (delay)
// is 30 minutes. That time period starts when the first user action causes a
// logging event.  This means that if there is no user action, there may be long
// periods without any (ongoing) log transmissions.  Ongoing logs typically
// contain very detailed records of user activities (ex: opened tab, closed
// tab, fetched URL, maximized window, etc.)  In addition, just before an
// ongoing log is closed out, a call is made to gather memory statistics.  Those
// memory statistics are deposited into a histogram, and the log finalization
// code is then called.  In the finalization, a call to a Histogram server
// acquires a list of all local histograms that have been flagged for upload
// to the UMA server.  The finalization also acquires the most recent number
// of page loads, along with any counts of renderer or plugin crashes.
//
// When the browser shuts down, there will typically be a fragment of an ongoing
// log that has not yet been transmitted.  At shutdown time, that fragment is
// closed (including snapshotting histograms), and persisted, for potential
// transmission during a future run of the product.
//
// There are two slightly abnormal shutdown conditions.  There is a
// "disconnected scenario," and a "really fast startup and shutdown" scenario.
// In the "never connected" situation, the user has (during the running of the
// process) never established an internet connection.  As a result, attempts to
// transmit the initial log have failed, and a lot(?) of data has accumulated in
// the ongoing log (which didn't yet get closed, because there was never even a
// contemplation of sending it).  There is also a kindred "lost connection"
// situation, where a loss of connection prevented an ongoing log from being
// transmitted, and a (still open) log was stuck accumulating a lot(?) of data,
// while the earlier log retried its transmission.  In both of these
// disconnected situations, two logs need to be, and are, persistently stored
// for future transmission.
//
// The other unusual shutdown condition, termed "really fast startup and
// shutdown," involves the deliberate user termination of the process before
// the initial log is even formed or transmitted. In that situation, no logging
// is done, but the historical crash statistics remain (unlogged) for inclusion
// in a future run's initial log.  (i.e., we don't lose crash stats).
//
// With the above overview, we can now describe the state machine's various
// states, based on the State enum specified in the state_ member.  Those states
// are:
//
//  CONSTRUCTED,          // Constructor was called.
//  INITIALIZED,          // InitializeMetricsRecordingState() was called.
//  INIT_TASK_SCHEDULED,  // Waiting for deferred init tasks to finish.
//  INIT_TASK_DONE,       // Waiting for timer to send the first ongoing log.
//  SENDING_LOGS,         // Sending logs and creating new ones when we run out.
//
// In more detail, we have:
//
//    INIT_TASK_SCHEDULED,    // Waiting for deferred init tasks to finish.
// Typically about 30 seconds after startup, a task is sent to a background
// thread to perform deferred (lower priority and slower) initialization steps
// such as getting the list of plugins.  That task will (when complete) make an
// async callback (via a Task) to indicate the completion.
//
//    INIT_TASK_DONE,         // Waiting for timer to send first ongoing log.
// The callback has arrived, and it is now possible for an ongoing log to be
// created.  This callback typically arrives back less than one second after
// the deferred init task is dispatched.
//
//    SENDING_LOGS,  // Sending logs and creating new ones when we run out.
// Logs from previous sessions have been loaded, and an optional initial
// stability log has been created. We will send all of these logs, and when
// they run out, we will start cutting new logs to send.  We will also cut a new
// log if we expect a shutdown.
//
// The progression through the above states is simple, and sequential.
// States proceed from INITIALIZED to SENDING_LOGS, and remain in the latter
// until shutdown.
//
// Also note that whenever we successfully send a log, we mirror the list
// of logs into the PrefService. This ensures that IF we crash, we won't start
// up and retransmit our old logs again.
//
// Due to race conditions, it is always possible that a log file could be sent
// twice.  For example, if a log file is sent, but not yet acknowledged by
// the external server, and the user shuts down, then a copy of the log may be
// saved for re-transmission.  These duplicates could be filtered out server
// side, but are not expected to be a significant problem.
