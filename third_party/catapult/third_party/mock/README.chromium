Description:
mock is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of
your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they
have been used.

In Python 3.3 onwards, it is a part of the standard library, available as
unittest.mock.

Local Modifications:
Removed everything except for mock.py (including setup script and documentation).
