// Note: before adding a new `WebContentsObserver` subclass, consider if simpler
// helpers will suffice:
//
// - Classes that have a 1:1 relationship with one RenderFrameHost can often
//   use `DocumentUserData` instead.
// - Mojo interface implementations that have a 1 RenderFrameHost to many
//   instances relationship can often use `DocumentService` instead.
// - `base::WeakPtr<WebContents>` and `WeakDocumentPtr` can be used instead of
//   manually clearing raw ptrs using observer methods like
//   `WebContentsDestroyed` or `RenderFrameDeleted`. Similarly, don't create a
//   `WebContentsObserver` just to be able to check for a null
//   `WebContentsObserver::web_contents()`. Use a `base::WeakPtr<WebContents>`
//   instead.
//
// These helpers can help avoid memory safety bugs, such as retaining a pointer
// to a deleted RenderFrameHost, or other security issues, such as origin
// confusion when a RenderFrameHost is reused after a cross-document navigation.

// An observer API implemented by classes which are interested in various page
// events from WebContents.  They also get a chance to filter IPC messages.
// The difference between WebContentsDelegate (WCD) and WebContentsObserver
// (WCO) is that there is one WCD per WebContents and many WCOs. Methods which
// have a return value, e.g. are expected to change state, should be on WCD.
//
// Since a WebContents can be a delegate to almost arbitrarily many
// RenderViewHosts, it is important to check in those WebContentsObserver
// methods which take a RenderViewHost that the event came from the
// RenderViewHost the observer cares about.
//
// Usually, observers should only care about the current RenderViewHost as
// returned by GetRenderViewHost().

// from the WebContentsObserver API. http://crbug.com/173325

  // the following cases:
  // 1) when the current RenderFrameHost in the primary main frame changes after

  // 2) when the current RenderFrameHost in the primary main frame is

  //
  // This method allows code to react to RenderFrameHost LifecycleState changes.
  // For example, to detect changes in the currently active document and perform

  // `navigation_handle` in DidFinishNavigation, just before it is destroyed.
  //
  // IMPORTANT NOTES:
  // - Starting a navigation doesn't affect which document is shown, or
  // (in many cases) which URL is displayed in the omnibox. Most effects of the
  // navigation only occur at DidFinishNavigation, if it commits. Feature code
  // generally should not use DidStartNavigation to reset their state (e.g.

  // navigation which is guaranteed not to commit (e.g. by navigating to
  // a URL returning a response with HTTP status code of 204 or a download).
  // Consider listening to PrimaryPageChanged or DidFinishNavigation instead.
  //
  // - This notification is fired by navigations in any frame of the
  // WebContents, not just the primary main frame.
  //
  // - This notification is fired by same-document navigations, such as fragment
  // navigations or pushState/replaceState, which will not result in a document
  // change. To filter these out, use NavigationHandle::IsSameDocument.
  //
  // - There can be more than one navigation ongoing in the same frame at the
  // same time (including the main frame). Each will get its own
  // NavigationHandle.
  //
  // - There is no guarantee that DidFinishNavigation will be called
  // for any particular navigation before DidStartNavigation is called on the
  // next.
  //

  // semantics (e.g. DidStartNavigationAttempt).
