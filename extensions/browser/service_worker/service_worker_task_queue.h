// A service worker implementation of `LazyContextTaskQueue`. For an overview of
// service workers on the web see https://web.dev/learn/pwa/service-workers.
// Extension workers do not follow the typical web worker lifecycle. At a high
// level:
//   * only one worker instance should run at any given time for an extension
//     (e.g. there should not be a active and waiting version)
//   * only one worker version (version of its code) should run for each browser
//     session
//   * events can be dispatched to the worker before it is activated
//
// This class, despite being a task queue, does much more than just queue tasks
// for the worker. It handles worker registration, starting/stopping, and task
// readiness monitoring. The highlights to understand this class are:
//
// Worker Registration:
//
// Worker registration must occur in order to start a worker for the extension.
// Otherwise requests to start a worker will fail. Service worker registration
// is persisted to disk in the //content layer to avoid unnecessary registration
// requests. This prevents a registration request for every restart of the
// browser. If there’s a registration record the registration is still verified
// with the //content layer).
//
// Worker Started/Stopped:
//
// Starting:
//
// A worker must be started before it can become ready to process the event
// tasks. Every task added outside of when the worker is starting will cause
// this class to request the worker to start. This is done this way because it
// is difficult to know if a worker is currently running and ready to process
// tasks.
//
// `DidStartServiceWorkerContext()` is called asynchronously from the extension
// renderer process (potentially before or after `DidStartWorkerForScope()`) and
// it records that the worker has started in the renderer (process).
//
// Stopping:
//
// TODO(crbug.com/40936639): update the below once `OnStopped()` is called to
// track browser starting.
//
// `DidStopServiceWorkerContext()` is called when the worker is stopped to track
// renderer stopping. `DidStopServiceWorkerContext()` is not always guaranteed
// to be called.
//
// Task Processing Readiness:
//
// Three worker started signals are together used to determine when a worker is
// ready to process tasks. Due to this it makes the process more complicated
// than just checking if the worker is “running” (e.g by calling the //content
// layer for this).
//
// A worker is checked for readiness by its worker state. Readiness checks three
// signals: `BrowserState`, `RendererState`, and `WorkerId` that are each set by
// certain methods:
//   * `BrowserState`: `DidStartWorkerForScope()` signal sets the value to
//     ready. This signal means that the worker was *requested* to start and it
//     verified that a worker registration exists at the //content layer. It is
//     considered the “browser-side” signal that the worker is ready.
//   * `RendererState`: `DidStartServiceWorkerContext()` signal sets the value
//     to ready. This is start requests are sent to the worker. This signal
//     means:
//       * that there is a worker renderer process thread running the service
//         worker code
//       * the worker has done one pass and executed it’s entire JS global scope
//       * as part of executing that scope: the worker has registered all its
//         (top-level/global) event listeners with the //extensions layer (all
//         event listener mojom calls have been received and processed). This
//         ordering is guaranteed because the mojom message that calls this
//         signal is after the event listener mojom messages on an associated
//         mojom pipe.
//   * `worker_id_.has_value()`: this signal confirms that
//     the class is populated with the running service worker’s information
//     (render process and thread id, and worker version id) . This confirms
//     that when the task is dispatched to the worker it is sent to the running
//     worker (and not a previously stopped one).
//
// Ordering of Registration and Start Worker Completion:
//
// Note that while worker registration in //content `DidRegisterServiceWorker()`
// will finish before requesting the worker to start, there is no guarantee on
// how the signals for their completion will be received.
//
//  For example `DidRegisterServiceWorker()`, `DidStartWorkerForScope()` and
//  `DidStartServiceWorkerContext()` signals are not guaranteed to finish in any
//  order.
//
// Activation Token:
//
// TODO(jlulejian): Explain how the activation token tracks
// activation/deactivation and how the class uses it.
//
// TODO(lazyboy): Clean up queue when extension is unloaded/uninstalled.
