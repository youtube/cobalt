caption: Allow automatic sign-in to Microsoft® cloud identity providers
default: 0
desc: |-
  Configures automatic user sign-in for accounts backed by a Microsoft® cloud identity provider.

  By setting this policy to 1 (<ph name="POLICY_VALUE_ENABLED">Enabled</ph>), users who sign into their computer with an account backed by a Microsoft® cloud identity provider (i.e., <ph name="MS_AAD_NAME">Microsoft® Azure® Active Directory®</ph> or the consumer Microsoft® account identity provider) or who have added a work or school account to <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph> can be signed into web properties using that identity automatically. Information pertaining to the user's device and account is transmitted to the user's cloud identity provider for each authentication event.

  By setting this policy to 0 (<ph name="POLICY_VALUE_DISABLED">Disabled</ph>) or leaving it unset, automatic sign-in as described above is disabled.

  This feature is available starting in <ph name="WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph> 10.

  Note: This policy doesn't apply to Incognito or Guest modes.
