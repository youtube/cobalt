PASS publicKey.toString() is '[object CryptoKey]'
PASS publicKey.type is 'public'
PASS publicKey.usages is ['verify']
PASS publicKey.algorithm.name is 'RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5'
PASS publicKey.algorithm.modulusLength is 2048
PASS bytesToHexString(publicKey.algorithm.publicExponent) is '010001'
PASS publicKey.algorithm.hash.name is 'SHA-256'

Importing a private key...
PASS privateKey.toString() is '[object CryptoKey]'
PASS privateKey.type is 'private'
PASS privateKey.usages is ['sign']
PASS privateKey.algorithm.name is 'RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5'
