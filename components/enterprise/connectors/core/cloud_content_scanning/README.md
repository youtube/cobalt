This directory includes cloud scanning code that is shared across Safe Browsing (SB) and Chrome Enterprise Premium (CEP) features. This includes:
  * CEP: Chrome Enterprise Connectors that scan content.
  * SB: Chrome Advanced Protection Program file download scans.

Code specific to CEP should be added to the parent directory (`//components/enterprise/connectors/core`) instead.
