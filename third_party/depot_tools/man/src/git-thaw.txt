SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git thaw'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`git thaw` takes a frozen branch (as made by linkgit:git-freeze[1]), and returns
it to the status that it was in before it was frozen.

If you freeze a branch multiple times (i.e. change files, freeze, change files,
freeze), `git thaw` will thaw all of the freezes.
