// SyncService is the central access point for configuring the sync machinery,

// Some high-level terms and concepts are described below; for detailed
// documentation about sync's inner workings, as well as an integration guide,
// see:  https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sync/
//
// Sync-the-feature vs sync-the-transport:
//
//   The sync machinery can operate in one of two modes:
//   * Sync-the-feature: The "classic" user-visible Sync feature. In addition to
//     signing in to Chrome, the user has to explicitly opt in to
//     Sync-the-feature (see signin::ConsentLevel::kSync and
//     SetInitialSyncFeatureSetupComplete()). In this mode, there is no
//     distinction between "local data" and "account data" - when turning on
//     Sync, everything is merged together, and this cannot be undone.
//   * Sync-the-transport: This mode gets enabled on signin to Chrome, with no
//     further opt-in required. In this mode, every data type is responsible for
//     keeping local data and account data separate from each other.
//   All APIs that are specific to sync-the-feature contain "SyncFeature" in
//   their name.
//
// Configuration:
//
//   Configuring sync, e.g. turning data types on or off, or enabling
//   encryption, happens through SyncUserSettings, accessible via
//   GetUserSettings(). In particular:
//    * SetSelectedTypes(): Set the data types the user wants to sync.
//    * SetDecryptionPassphrase(): Attempt to decrypt the user's encrypted data
//      using the passed passphrase.
//    * SetEncryptionPassphrase(): Re-encrypt the user's data using the passed
//      passphrase.
//
// Initial sync setup (Sync-the-feature mode only):
//
//   For privacy reasons, it is usually desirable to avoid syncing any data
//   types until the user has finished setting up sync. There are two APIs
//   that control the initial sync download:
//
//    * SyncUserSettings::SetInitialSyncFeatureSetupComplete()
//    * GetSetupInProgressHandle()
//
//   SetInitialSyncFeatureSetupComplete() should be called once the user has
//   finished setting up sync at least once on their account.
//   GetSetupInProgressHandle() should be called while the user is actively
//   configuring their account. The handle should be deleted once configuration
//   is complete.
//
//   Once first setup has completed and there are no outstanding
//   setup-in-progress handles, datatype configuration will begin.
//
// Terminology: "Enabled" vs "active":
//
//   These terms can refer to either sync as a whole or to individual data
//   types.
//   * Enabled: Think "configuration" - all the necessary preconditions are
//     fulfilled, e.g. the user is signed in, hasn't opted out, etc. However,
//     sync may not actually be running (yet), and there's no guarantee that it
//     will (e.g. there might be an auth error that hasn't been detected yet, or
//     the sync server may be unreachable, etc).
//   * Active: Think "runtime state" - sync has finished initializing and is
//     actually running right now, i.e. data is being continuously synchronized
//     with the server. A data type is only considered active once its "initial
//     sync" is done, i.e. all account data has been downloaded and applied
//     locally.
//
//   For the detailed state of individual data types, also see
//   GetDownloadStatusFor() and syncer::GetUploadToGoogleState().
