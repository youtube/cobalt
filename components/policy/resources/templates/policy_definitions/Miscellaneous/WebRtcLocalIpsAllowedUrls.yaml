caption: URLs for which local IPs are exposed in WebRTC ICE candidates
desc: |-
  Patterns in this list will be matched against the security origin of the requesting URL.
        If a match is found or chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns is Disabled, the local IP addresses are shown in WebRTC ICE candidates.
        Otherwise, local IP addresses are concealed with mDNS hostnames.
        Please note that this policy weakens the protection of local IPs if needed by administrators.
