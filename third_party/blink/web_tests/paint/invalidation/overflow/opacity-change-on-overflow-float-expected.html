<p>Repaint test for <rdar><!-- 
An explanation as to why this is here.  In the beginning, there was an
<rdar:://problem/6869687> link to rdar.  However, that link was invisible
because it was enclosed in angle brackets.

This was fine, until we implemented the HTML5 parsing algorithm, which changed
the name of the rdar element to not include // charaters.  Rather than
regenerate the expected results (which were platform specific), the rdar link
was changed to an <rdar> element and the expected render tree was hand-edited.
--> REGRESSION (r41203): Facebook friend suggestions disappear on update.  Make sure when a layer switches
from being self-painting to non-self-painting that a layout happens to fix up the floating objects lists.  You should see a 100x100 green square below.
If you see any red, the test has failed.
