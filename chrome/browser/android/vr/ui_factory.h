// and an app bundle-specific factory that opens a shared library, fishes for a
// factory method, and creates a UI from it.
//
// Either one variant or the other is compiled in.  Alternatively, there could
// be a single factory instance, which switches behavior based on the results of
// an IsBundle() method.  A downside of that is that we start to include
// bundle-specific code in non-bundle builds, and vice-versa.
