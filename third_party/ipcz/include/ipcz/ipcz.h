#define IPCZ_INCLUDE_IPCZ_IPCZ_H_

// ipcz is a cross-platform C library for interprocess communication (IPC) which
// supports efficient routing and data transfer over a large number of
// dynamically relocatable messaging endpoints.
//
// ipcz operates in terms of a small handful of abstractions encapsulated in
// this header: nodes, portals, parcels, drivers, boxes, and traps.
//
// NOTE: This header is intended to compile under C++11 or newer, and C99 or
// newer. The ABI defined here can be considered stable.
//
// Glossary
// --------
// *Nodes* are used by ipcz to model isolated units of an application. A typical
// application will create one ipcz node within each OS process it controls.
//
// *Portals* are messaging endpoints which belong to a specific node. Portals
// are created in entangled pairs: whatever goes into one portal comes out the
// other (its "peer"). Pairs may be created local to a single node, or they may
// be created to span two nodes. Portals may also be transferred freely through
// other portals.
//
// *Parcels* are the unit of communication between portals. Parcels can contain
// arbitrary application data as well as ipcz handles. Handles within a parcel
// are used to transfer objects (namely other portals, or driver-defined
// objects) from one portal to another, potentially on a different node.
//
// *Traps* provide a flexible mechanism to observe interesting portal state
// changes such as new parcels arriving or a portal's peer being closed.
//
// *Drivers* are provided by applications to implement platform-specific IPC
// details. They may also define new types of objects to be transmitted in
// parcels via boxes.
//
// *Boxes* are opaque objects used to wrap driver- or application-defined
// objects for seamless transmission across portals. Applications use the Box()
// and Unbox() APIs to go between concrete objects and transferrable box
// handles, and ipcz delegates to the driver or application to serialize boxed
// objects as needed for transmission.
//
// Overview
// --------
// To use ipcz effectively, an application must create multiple nodes to be
// interconnected. One node must be designated as the "broker" by the
// application (see CreateNode() flags). The broker is used by ipcz to
// coordinate certain types of internal transactions which demand a heightened
// level of trust and capability, so a broker node should always live in a more
// trustworthy process. For example in Chrome, the browser process is
// designated as the broker.
//
// In order for a node to communicate with other nodes in the system, the
// application must explicitly connect it to ONE other node using the
// ConnectNode() API. Once this is done, ipcz can automatically connect the node
// to additional other nodes as needed for efficient portal operation.
//
// In the example below, assume node A is designated as the broker. Nodes A and
// B have been connected directly by ConnectNode() calls in the application.
// Nodes A and C have been similarly connected:
//
//                    ┌───────┐
//     ConnectNode()  │       │  ConnectNode()
//        ┌──────────>O   A   O<───────────┐
//        │           │       │            │
//        │           └───────┘            │
//        │                                │
//        v ConnectNode()                  v ConnectNode()
//    ┌───O───┐                        ┌───O───┐

//    │       │                        │       │
//    └───────┘                        └───────┘
//
// ConnectNode() establishes initial portal pairs to link the two nodes
// together, illustrated above as "O"s. Once ConnectNode() returns, the
// application may immediately begin transmitting parcels through these portals.
//
// Now suppose node B creates a new local pair of portals (using OpenPortals())
// and sends one of those new portals in a parcel through its
// already-established portal to node A. The sent portal is effectively
// transferred to node A, and because its entangled peer still lives on node B
// there are now TWO portal pairs between nodes A and B:
//
//                    ┌───────┐

//    └───────┘                        └───────┘
//
// Finally, suppose now the application takes this new portal on node A and
// sends it further along, through node A's already-established portal to node
// C. Because the transferred portal's peer still lives on node B, there is now
// a portal pair spanning nodes B and C:

  // Serialize()
  // ===========
  //
  // Serializes a driver object identified by `handle` into a collection of
  // bytes and readily transmissible driver objects, for eventual transmission
  // over `transport`. At a minimum this must support serialization of transport
  // and memory objects created by the same driver. Any other driver objects
  // intended for applications to box and transmit through portals must also be
  // serializable here.
  //
  // If the object identified by `handle` is invalid or unserializable, the
  // driver must ignore all other arguments (including `transport`) and return
  // IPCZ_RESULT_INVALID_ARGUMENT.
  //
  // If the object can be serialized but success may depend on the value of
  // `transport`, and `transport` is IPCZ_INVALID_DRIVER_HANDLE, the driver must
  // return IPCZ_RESULT_ABORTED. ipcz may invoke Serialize() in this way to
  // query whether a specific object can be serialized at all, even when it
  // doesn't have a specific transport in mind.
  //
  // If the object can be serialized or transmitted as-is and `transport` is
  // valid, but the serialized outputs would not be transmissible over
  // `transport` specifically, the driver must ignore all other arguments and
  // return IPCZ_RESULT_PERMISSION_DENIED. This implies that neither end of
  // `transport` is sufficiently privileged or otherwise able to transfer the
  // object directly, and in this case ipcz may instead attempt to relay the
  // object through a more capable broker node.
  //
  // For all other outcomes, the object identified by `handle` is considered to
  // be serializable.
  //
  // `num_bytes` and `num_handles` on input point to the capacities of the
  // respective output buffers provided by `data` and `handles`. If either
  // capacity pointer is null, a capacity of zero is implied; and if either
  // input capacity is zero, the corresponding output buffer may be null.
  //
  // Except in the failure modes described above, the driver must update any
  // non-null capacity input to reflect the exact capacity required to serialize
  // the object. For example if `num_bytes` is non-null and the object
  // serializes to 8 bytes of data, `*num_bytes` must be set to 8 upon return.
  //
  // If serializing the object requires more data or handle capacity than ipcz
  // provided, the driver must return IPCZ_RESULT_RESUORCE_EXHAUSTED after
  // updating the capacity values as described above. In this case the driver
  // must not touch `data` or `handles`.
  //
  // Finally, if the input capacities were both sufficient, the driver must fill
  // `data` and `handles` with a serialized representation of the object and
  // return IPCZ_RESULT_OK. In this case ipcz relinquishes `handle` and will no
  // longer refer to it.

  //
  // Establishment of this connection is typically asynchronous, but this

  // node will behave as if their peer has been closed. On the other hand if the
  // remote node gives a larger `num_initial_portals`, then its own excess
  // portals will behave as if their peer has been closed.
  //
  // If IPCZ_CONNECT_NODE_TO_BROKER is given in `flags`, the remote node must
  // be a broker node, and the calling node will treat it as such. If the
  // calling node is also a broker, the brokers' respective networks will be
  // effectively merged as long as both brokers remain alive: nodes in one
  // network will be able to discover and communicate directly with nodes in the
  // other network. Note that when two networks are merged, each broker remains

  // ConnectNode() call.
  //
  // If IPCZ_CONNECT_NODE_TO_ALLOCATION_DELEGATE is given in `flags`, the

  //
  // If the caller does not provide enough storage capacity for all data and

  //
  // If IPCZ_GET_PARTIAL is specified, capacity requirements are not enforced.
  // Instead the call succeeds after copying as much data and handles as will
  // fit in the provided buffers. Upon return `*num_bytes` and `*num_handles`
  // are set to the capacity actually consumed from the parcel.
  //
  // Parcel data is never consumed per se, so multiple consecutive partial gets

  // BeginGet()
  // ==========
  //
  // Begins a get-transaction on `source` to retrieve data and handles. If
  // `source` is a portal this operates on the parcel at the head of the
  // portal's incoming queue; if `source` is a parcel (as returned by a prior
  // EndGet() or as extracted from a box of type IPCZ_BOX_TYPE_SUBPARCEL), this
  // operates directly on the parcel itself.
  //
  // `transaction` must be non-null. On success `*transaction` is set to a value
  // which can be used to finalize the transaction via `EndGet()`.
  //
  // If `data` is non-null, `*data` is set to the address of readable data for
  // the caller to consume. If `num_bytes` is not null, `*num_bytes` is set to
  // the number of bytes stored at the returned data address. If the parcel has
  // no data, `*data` is set to null and `*num_bytes` is set to zero. Any
  // returned data address remains valid only until the transaction is
  // terminated, either by calling EndGet() or by closing `source`.
  //
  // NOTE: When performing get-transactions, callers should be mindful of
  // time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities. Exposed parcel memory
  // may be shared with (and still writable in) the process which transmitted
  // the parcel, and that process may not be trustworthy.
  //
  // Handles
  // -------
  // Unless the parcel has no handles attached or IPCZ_BEGIN_GET_PARTIAL is
  // set in `flags`, `handles` must be non-null and `*num_handles` must convey
  // the storage capacity available in `handles`. If the parcel has more than
  // `*num_handles` handles attached (or any handles, if `num_handles` is null),
  // the call fails with IPCZ_RESULT_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. In this case if
  // `num_handles` is not null, `*num_handles` is set to the number of handles
  // actually attached to the parcel.
  //
  // Ownership of any handles copied into `handles` is immediately assumed by
  // the caller once a successful BeginGet() returns, even if the transaction is
  // later aborted (see IPCZ_END_GET_ABORT).
  //
  // If IPCZ_BEGIN_GET_PARTIAL is set in `flags`, handle capacity constraints
  // are not enforced: BeginGet() will copy (and transfer ownership of) only as
  // many handles as will fit in the caller's provided handle buffer and any
  // additional handles will remain attached to the parcel. In this case the
  // output value of `*num_handles` will reflect the number of handles actually
  // copied into the caller's buffer.
  //
  // Concurrent Transactions
  // -----------------------
  // By default BeginGet() establishes exclusive access to `source`, blocking it
  // from starting additional get-transactions until the current one has ended.
  // If, however, `source` is a portal and IPCZ_BEGIN_GET_OVERLAPPED is set in
  // `flags`, the underlying parcel is immediately dequeued from the portal and
  // owned exclusively by the new transaction. This allows the application to
  // begin and maintain concurrent get-transactions on the same portal.
  //
  // If `source` is not a portal, get-transactions are always exclusive and it's
  // invalid to specify IPCZ_BEGIN_GET_OVERLAPPED.
  //
  // `options` is ignored and must be null.
  //

  //        `*data` is set to the address of the transaction's data buffer. If
  //        `num_bytes` is non-null, `*num_bytes` is set to the size of the data

  //
  // Attempts to install a trap to catch interesting changes to a portal's
  // state. The condition(s) to observe are specified in `conditions`.
  // Regardless of what conditions the caller specifies, all successfully
  // installed traps also implicitly observe IPCZ_TRAP_REMOVED.
  //
  // If successful, ipcz guarantees that `handler` will be invoked -- with the
  // the `context` field of the invocation's IpczTrapEvent reflecting the value
  // of `context` given here -- once any of the specified conditions have been
  // met.
  //
  // Immediately before invoking its handler, the trap is removed from the
  // portal and must be reinstalled in order to observe further state changes.
  //
  // When a portal is closed, any traps still installed on it are notified by
  // invoking their handler with IPCZ_TRAP_REMOVED in the event's
  // `condition_flags`. This effectively guarantees that all installed traps
  // eventually see a handler invocation.
  //
  // Note that `handler` may be invoked from any thread that can modify the
  // state of the observed portal. This is limited to threads which make direct
  // ipcz calls on the portal, and any threads on which the portal's node may
  // receive notifications from a driver transport.
