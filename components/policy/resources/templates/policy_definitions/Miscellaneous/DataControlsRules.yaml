caption: Sets a list of Data Controls rules.
desc: |-
  Configures a list of Data Control rules to prevent data leaks.

        Each rule consists of the following:
        - Condition fields to trigger that rule. A rule will only trigger if a user action matches all the fields populated in its <ph name="DATA_CONTROLS_SOURCES">sources</ph>, <ph name="DATA_CONTROLS_DESTINATIONS">destinations</ph>, <ph name="DATA_CONTROLS_AND">and</ph>, <ph name="DATA_CONTROLS_OR">or</ph> and <ph name="DATA_CONTROLS_NOT">not</ph> fields. For list sub-fields, only one entry needs to be matched, for example only one URL pattern needs to match to trigger the rule.
        - A list of restrictions to be applied. Depending on the restriction, only <ph name="DATA_CONTROLS_SOURCES">sources</ph> or <ph name="DATA_CONTROLS_DESTINATIONS">destinations</ph> conditions may be available.

        Rules can be added to:
        - Control the clipboard data shared between the sources and the destinations.
        - Control blocking screenshots based on the source tabs.

        If <ph name="ON_SECURITY_EVENT_ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR">OnSecurityEventEnterpriseConnector</ph> policy is set to True, triggered rules are reported to the admin.
        The restriction level can be set to BLOCK, WARN, or REPORT.
        - If the restriction level is set to BLOCK, the action won't be allowed.
        - If the restriction level is set to WARN, a user will be warned and may choose to proceed with or cancel the action.
        - If the restriction level is set to REPORT, the user action will not be interrupted, but a report will be sent if <ph name="ON_SECURITY_EVENT_ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR">OnSecurityEventEnterpriseConnector</ph> policy is enabled.

        Notes:
        - Format the URL patterns according to this format ( https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format ).
        - For data leak prevention rules specific to <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>, see also the <ph name="DATA_LEAK_PREVENTION_RULES_LIST">DataLeakPreventionRulesList</ph> policy.

        If the policy is left not set, no restrictions will be applied.

        This policy is available only to users who have an assigned Chrome Enterprise Premium license.
