caption: Integrated second factor authentication mode
desc: |-
  Specifies how the on-board secure element hardware can be used to provide a second-factor authentication if it is compatible with this feature. The machine power button is used to detect the user physical presence.

        If 'Disabled' is selected, no second factor is provided.

        If 'U2F' is selected, the integrated second factor will behave according the FIDO U2F specification.

        If 'U2F_EXTENDED' is selected, the integrated second factor will provide the U2F functions plus some extensions for individual attestation.
