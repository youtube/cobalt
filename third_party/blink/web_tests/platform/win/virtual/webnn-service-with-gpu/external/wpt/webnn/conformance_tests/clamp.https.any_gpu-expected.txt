[FAIL] clamp int32 1D tensor
  assert_less_than_equal: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test clamp int32 actual 2147483647 should be close enough to expected 2147483645 by ULP distance: expected a number less than or equal to 0 but got 2
[FAIL] clamp uint32 1D tensor
  assert_less_than_equal: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test clamp uint32 actual 4294967295 should be close enough to expected 4294967290 by ULP distance: expected a number less than or equal to 0 but got 5
[FAIL] clamp int64 1D tensor
  assert_less_than_equal: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test clamp int64 actual -4147483648 should be close enough to expected -2 by ULP distance: expected a number less than or equal to 0n but got 4147483646n
[FAIL] clamp uint64 1D tensor
  assert_less_than_equal: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test clamp uint64 actual 5294967295 should be close enough to expected 5294967290 by ULP distance: expected a number less than or equal to 0n but got 5n
