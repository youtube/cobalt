        """Declare a recipe for the given package.

        A wrapper around luci.recipe with a fixed cipd_package and some
        chromium-specific functionality. See
        https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/HEAD/lucicfg/doc/README.md#luci.recipe
        for more information.

        Args:
            name: The name to use to refer to the executable in builder
              definitions. Must start with "recipe:". See luci.recipe for more
              information.
            cipd_version: See luci.recipe.
            recipe: See luci.recipe.
            bootstrappable: Whether or not the recipe supports the chromium
              bootstrapper. A recipe supports the bootstrapper if the following
              conditions are met:
              * chromium_bootstrap.update_gclient_config is called to update the
                gclient config that is used for bot_update. This will be true if
                calling chromium_checkout.ensure_checkout or
                chromium_tests.prepare_checkout.
              * If the recipe does analysis to reduce compilation/testing, it
                skips analysis and performs a full build if
                chromium_bootstrap.skip_analysis_reasons is non-empty. This will
                be true if calling chromium_tests.determine_compilation_targets.
              In addition to a True or False value, POLYMORPHIC can be
              specified. This value will cause the builder's executable to be
              changed to the bootstrapper in properties-optional, polymorphic
              mode, which will by default not bootstrap any properties. On a
              per-run basis the $bootstrap/properties property can be set to
              bootstrap properties for different builders.
            experiments: Experiments to apply to a builder using the recipe. If
              the builder specifies an experiment, the experiment value from the
              recipe will be ignored.
