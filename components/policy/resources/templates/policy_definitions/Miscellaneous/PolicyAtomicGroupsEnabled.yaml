caption: Enables the concept of policy atomic groups
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled means policies coming from an atomic group that don't share the source with the highest priority from that group get ignored.

        Setting the policy to Disabled means no policy is ignored because of its source. Policies are ignored only if there's a conflict, and the policy doesn't have the highest priority.

        If this policy is set from a cloud source, it can't target a specific user.
