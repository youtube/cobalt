// The SystemGeolocationSource is responsible for listening to geolocation
// permissions from the operation system and allows the GeolocationManager to
// access it in a platform agnostic manner. This concrete implementation is to
// be used within lacros browser. It listens to permission changes in ash.
//
// Note on sequencing:
// There is a race condition as OnPrefChanged is called asynchronously from the
// Crosapi. There are two steps that need to be done during creation: 1) Bind to
// the crosapi (This will schedule an async call (A) to OnPrefChanged() with the
// initial value) 2) Set the callback (The callback must be then called with the
// init value from the crosapi).
//
// Now there are 2 options how this can go:
// 1,2,A - now during (2) we actually don't have the value to report, hence we
// need to rely on A to call the callback that we set in 2. 1,A,2 - now during
// (A) we don't have the callback set yet, hence we just save it to a member
// variable and the callback is going to be called in (2)
//
// The code can handle both situations:
// but it relies on these three tasks (1,2,A) to not run in parallel.
// We achieve this by making sure they are executed by the same sequential task
// runner.
