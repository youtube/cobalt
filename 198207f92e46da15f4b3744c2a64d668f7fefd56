      "message": "Okay, I have submitted the change as-is internally, and it will be available in the next OSS push.\n\nHowever, concerning this define, this file is reserved for public #defines that are to be read by the common application code, so I don\u0027t think that this is the right place for this Tizen-specific #define.\n\nIn a new CL, would you consider instead moving this into a new header file (e.g. something like \"tizen_defines.h\" or \"tizen_configuration.h\")?  It may be reasonable for you to also add \u0027#include \"starboard/shared/internal_only.h\"\u0027 to that new header file, to ensure that the define is never exposed to common application code.",
