# Setting up a new builder

This doc describes how to set up a new builder on LUCI. It's focused
on Chromium builders, but parts may be applicable to other projects.

[TOC]

## TL;DR

For a typical chromium builder using the chromium recipe, you'll need to file a
bug for tracking purposes, acquire a host, and then land **two** CLs:

1. in [infradata/config][16], modifying `chromium.star`.
1. in [chromium/src][18], modifying all of the following:
    1. LUCI service configurations and recipe configurations in
        `//infra/config`
    1. Compile configuration in `//tools/mb`
    1. Test configuration in `//testing/buildbot`

## Background

There are two kinds of builders: "try builders" (also known as pre-submit
builders, which test patches before they land) and "CI builders" (also
known as post-submit builders, which test configurations on the committed
code). "CQ builders" are try builders that the
[CQ (Commit Queue)](cq.md) will run on every CL when it is being submitted;
non-CQ try builders are called "optional" try builders.

Try builders normally pick up their configuration from a "mirrored" (i.e.,
matching) CI builder (the mapping is set in the `mirrors` field in the try
builder's definition) and run the same set of tests/compile the same set of
targets. However, they can be configured to use slightly different GN args
(usually to enable DCHECKs on release builders) and (rarely) to run different
tests or run them with different flags. [ We enable dchecks on the release
builders as a compromise between the speed of a release builder and the coverage
of a debug builder]. Note that differences between the try builders and the CI
builders can cause changes to land that break the CI builders, which is
unfortunate, but a known tradeoff we make.

Every try builder should mirror a CI builder, to help identify when failures
are specific to a given patch, or happening more generally, and, if the latter,
that some sheriff is looking at the failures.

[ Sometimes it's okay to have an "optional" try builder that doesn't have a
matching CI builder, but make sure to discuss that on the bug you're using
for this work. ]

Every CI builder should normally also have a mirrored try builder, so that you
can test changes that will affect the CI builder before landing. The only time
you would set up a CI builder that didn't have a matching try builder should be
if you couldn't set one up for some reason (e.g., we don't have enough capacity
for both, or some other limitation of the infrastructure).

> **Note:** not every CI builder that should have a matching try builder
> currently does, unfortunately (see
> [crbug.com/709214](https://crbug.com/709214)). Also, it can be hard to figure
> out what the corresponding builders are for builders that have not been
> migrated src-side: you have to look at [trybots.py][25] for the mapping
> (embedded in the code). For CI builders with config specified src-side, the
> generated properties file will have the builders that mirror them identified
> in the `mirroring_builder_group_and_names` field.

All CQ builders *must* have mirrored CI builders.

## Pick a name and a builder group

Your new builder's name should follow the [chromium builder naming scheme][3].

Builders are put into builder groups, with the group acting as part of the key
used for looking up configuration for the builder in various places. Builders
are also grouped within Milo UI pages according to the builder group. Builder
groups are somewhat arbitrary, but there are some builder groups with
significance:

* `chromium.$OS` - These are builder groups for builders that provide testing
  coverage for a specific OS. These builders are watched by the main sheriff
  rotation so they must be in a state where builds generally succeed.
* `chromium` - This is a builder group for builders that produce archived builds
  for each OS. These builders are watched by the main sheriff rotation.
* `chromium.fyi` - This is a catch-all builder group for FYI builders (builders
  that do not have a formal sheriff rotation). Avoid using this, instead add
  to/create an OS-specific FYI builder group if you are testing an OS-specific
  configuration (e.g. `chromium.android.fyi`) or a feature/team-specific builder
  group (e.g. `chromium.updater`).

> **Note:** If you're creating a try builder, its name should match the name of
> the CI builder it mirrors. The builder group for the try builder should
> usually be the builder group of the CI builder appended to `tryserver.`.
> However, not every existing builder does this
> ([crbug.com/905879](https://crbug.com/905879)).

## Obtain a host

When you're setting up a new builder, you'll need a host to run it. For CQ try
bots, you'll likely need a large number of hosts to handle the load in parallel.
For CI / waterfall builders or manually triggered try builders, you'll typically
only need a single host.

To acquire the hosts, please file a [resource request][1] (internal) and
describe the amount needed, along with any specialized hardware that's required
(e.g. mac hardware, attached mobile devices, a specific GPU, etc.). Note that
even if there's hardware currently available for the new builder, a resource
request will still be needed if the footprint of the new builder equates to
at least 5 VMs or 50 CPU cores per hour. See
[go/estimating-bot-capacity](https://goto.google.com/estimating-bot-capacity)
for guidance on how many hosts to request.

See [infradata docs][4] (internal) for information on how to register
the hardware to be used by your builder.

## Chromium configuration

Lastly, you need to configure a variety of things in the chromium repo.
It's generally ok to land all of them in a single CL.

### Starlark

LUCI services used by chromium are configured in [//infra/config][6].

The configuration is written in Starlark and used to generate Protobuf files
which are also checked in to the repo. In addition to the LUCI services
configuration files, the starlark also generates per-builder files that are used
by the builder's executable.

Generating all of the LUCI services configuration files for the production
builders is done by executing [main.star][22] or running
`lucicfg generate main.star`.

#### Buildbucket

Buildbucket is responsible for taking a build scheduled by a user or
an agent and translating it into a swarming task. Its configuration
includes things like:

* ACLs for scheduling and viewing builds
* Swarming dimensions
* Recipe name and properties

Chromium's buildbucket Starlark configuration is [here][23].
Chromium's generated buildbucket configuration is [here][8].
Buildbucket's configuration schema is [here][7].

Each bucket has a corresponding `.star` file where the builders for the bucket
are defined.

Most builders are defined using the builder function from [builders.star][24]
(or some function that wraps it), which simplifies setting the most common
dimensions and properties and provides a unified interface for setting
module-level defaults.

A typical chromium builder won't need to configure much; module-level defaults
apply values that are widely used for the bucket (e.g. bucket and executable).

Each builder group has a function (sometimes multiple) defined that can be used
to define a builder that sets the `builder_group` property to the group and sets
group-specific defaults. Find the block of builders defined using the
appropriate function and add a new definition, which may be as simple as:

```starlark
ci.linux_builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
)
```

You can generate the configuration files and then view the added entry in
[cr-buildbucket.cfg][8] to make sure all properties and dimensions are set as
expected and adjust your definition as necessary.

#### Milo

Milo is responsible for displaying builders and build histories on a
set of consoles. Its configuration includes the definitions of those
consoles.

Chromium's milo Starlark configuration is intermixed with the
[builder definitions][23].
Chromium's generated milo configuration is [here][10].
Milo's configuration schema is [here][9].

A typical chromium builder should be added to one or two consoles
at most: one corresponding to its builder group, and possibly the main
console.

##### CI builders

The sequence of CI builds for a builder corresponds to a linear history of
revisions in the repository, and the console takes advantage of that, allowing
you to compare what revisions are in what builds for different builders in the
console.

```starlark
consoles.console_view(
    name = '$BUILDER_GROUP_NAME',
    ...  # There is often an ordering argument that controls what order the
         # entries in the console are displayed
)

ci.linux_builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
    ...
    console_view = consoles.console_view_entry(
        # A builder's category is a pipe-delimited list of strings
        # that determines how a builder is grouped on a console page.
        # N>=0
        category = '$CATEGORY1|$CATEGORY2|...|$CATEGORYN',

        # A builder's short name is the name that shows up in the column for
        # the builder in the console view.
        short_name = '$SHORT_NAME',
    ),
)
```

Both category and short_name can be omitted, but is strongly recommended that
all entries include short name.

##### Try builders

The sequence of builds for a try builder does not correspond to a linear history
of revisions. Consequently, the interface for the consoles is different, as is
the method of defining the console. Try builders will by default be added to a
list view with the same name as its builder group and also to a console that
includes all try builders, so nothing usually needs to be done to update a
console when adding a builder to an existing builder group.

```starlark
consoles.list_view(
    name = '$BUILDER_GROUP_NAME',
)
```

#### Scheduler (CI / waterfall builders only)

The scheduler is responsible for triggering CI / waterfall builders.

Chromium's scheduler Starlark configuration is intermixed with the
[builder definitions][23].
Chromium's generated scheduler configuration is [here][12].
Scheduler's configuration schema is [here][11].

##### Poller

To trigger builders when changes are landed on a repo, a poller needs to be
defined. The poller defines the repo and refs to watch and triggers builders
when changes land on one of the watched refs.

Pollers are already defined for all of the active refs within chromium/src. The
modules for the `ci` bucket are written such that builders will be triggered by
the appropriate poller by default. Setting the `triggered_by` field on a builder
will disable this default behavior.

##### Triggered by another builder

Builders that will be triggered by other builders (e.g. a builder compiles tests
and then triggers another builder to actually run the tests) call this out in
their own definition by setting the `triggered_by` field. For builders in the
`ci` bucket, this will disable the default behavior of being triggered by the
poller.

```starlark
ci.linux_builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
    triggered_by = ['$PARENT_BUILDER_NAME'],
)
```

##### Scheduled

Builders that need to run regularly but not in response to landed code can be
scheduled using the `schedule` field in their definition. For builders in the
`ci` bucket, the `triggered_by` field should be set to an empty list to disable
the default behavior of being triggered by the poller. See the documentation of
the `schedule` field in the `Job` message in the [scheduler schema][11].

```starlark
ci.builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
    schedule = 'with 10m interval',
    triggered_by = [],
)
```

#### CQ (try builders only)

CQ is responsible for launching try builders against CLs before they are
submitted to verify that they don't cause any breakages.

Chromium's CQ Starlark configuration is intermixed with the
[builder definitions][23].
Chromium's generated CQ configuration is [here][26].
CQ's configuration schema is [here][27].

##### Opt-in try builders

Opt-in try builders are not automatically added to any CQ attempts, they must be
requested using the Cq-Include-Trybots footer. By default, try builders will be
opt-in try builders.

##### CQ builders

CQ builders are automatically added to CQ attempts. They can be configured to
only be added on specific paths or to be triggered experimentally some
percentage of the time. Adding builders to the CQ has a substantial cost, so
doing so will require approval from a limited set of approvers. This is enforced
by OWNERS files, so no need to worry about accidentally doing so.

To add a builder to the CQ, add a `tryjob` value to the builder definition.

This will add the builder to all CQ attempts (except for CLs that only contain
files in some particular directories).

The starlark config files for builders are organized by builder_group. For
example, the linux builders are in
//infra/config/subprojects/chromium/try/tryserver.chromium.linux.star. These
files have default values set for all builders in each particular file.

###### Regular (non-Orchestrator) CQ builders

```starlark
try_.builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
    tryjob = try_.job(),
)
```

###### Orchestrator CQ Builders

The Orchestrator pattern is an optimization from the old chromium_trybot CQ
builders, where compiles are triggered to run on separate beefier machines.
It consists of the chromium/orchestrator.py and chromium/compilator.py recipes.

Builders using the Orchestrator pattern use a dedicated pool of machines to run
their builds (often called builderful). The
Orchestrator builder uses 2 or 4 core bots and the Compilator builder uses a
beefier >=16 core bot. The Compilator builder name should always be the
orchestrator name + "-compilator", like linux-rel and linux-rel-compilator.

In //infra/config/subprojects/chromium/try/tryserver.chromium.linux.star:

```starlark
try_.orchestrator_builder(
    name = "linux-rel",
    compilator = "linux-rel-compilator",
    branch_selector = branches.STANDARD_MILESTONE,
    main_list_view = "try",
    use_clang_coverage = True,
    coverage_test_types = ["unit", "overall"],
    tryjob = try_.job(),
)

try_.compilator_builder(
    name = "linux-rel-compilator",
    branch_selector = branches.STANDARD_MILESTONE,
    main_list_view = "try",
)
```

In infradata/config/configs/chromium-swarm/bots/chromium/chromium.star:
(In the [infradata/config](https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/infradata/config/) repo)

```starlark
try_bots({
    "linux-rel": chrome.gce_bionic(
        prefix = "linux-rel-orchestrator-2-core",
        zone = "us-central1-b",
        machine_type = "n1-standard-2",
        lifetime = time.week,
        amount = 80,
    ),
    "linux-rel-compilator": chrome.gce_bionic(
        prefix = "linux-rel-compilator-ssd-16-core",
        zone = "us-central1-b",
        machine_type = "n1-standard-16",
        lifetime = time.week,
        amount = 25,
        disk_gb = 100,
        // This enables local ssd usage for this bot
        scratch_disks = chrome.scratch_disks(count = 1, interface = "NVME"),
    ),
})
```

###### Experimental CQ builders

Sometimes as a way of testing new features for try builders or as a precursor to
adding a builder to the CQ, it will be added as an experimental CQ builder,
which will be triggered for some percentage of CQ attempts. Such builds will not
block the completion of the CQ attempt and its status will not be considered for
determining the status of the CQ attempt.

To add a builder to the CQ experimentally, add a `tryjob` value to the builder
definition that specifies `experiment_percentage`.

```starlark
try_.chromium_linux_builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
    tryjob = try_.job(
        experiment_percentage = 5,
    ),
)
```

###### Path-based CQ builders

Sometimes it will be determined that a try builder is too expensive or catches
too few errors to be added to all CQ attempts, but that it is effective at
catching errors introduced when certain files are changed. In that case, the try
builder can be added to the CQ only when those files are changed.

To add a builder to the CQ on a path basis, add a `tryjob` value to the builder
definition that specifies `location_regexp`.

```starlark
try_.chromium_linux_builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
    tryjob = try_.job(
        # ".+/[+]/" Matches the repo/+/ prefix of the gitiles file location
        location_regexp = ".+/[+]/path/with/affected/files",
    ),
)
```

#### Common mistakes

##### Setting branch_selector

A value should only be passed to the `branch_selector` argument if the builder
should run against the branches. This is uncommon, see the [Branched
builders](#branched-builders) section for information on whether a builder
should be branched.

##### Setting tree_closing (CI builder)

The `tree_closing` argument should only be set to `True` if compile failures for
the builder should prevent additional changes from being landed. This should
generally be restricted to builders that are watched by a sheriffing rotation.

##### Setting main_console_view (CI builder)

A value should usually be passed to the `main_console_view` argument if the
builder is in one of the builder groups that is watched by the main chromium
sheriff rotation (*chromium*, *chromium.win*, *chromium.mac*, *chromium.linux*,
*chromium.chromiumos* and *chromium.memory*).

##### Setting cq_mirror_console_view (CI builder)

A value should only be passed to the `cq_mirrors_console_view` argument if the
builder is the mirror of a non-experimental try builder on the CQ.

### Recipe-specific configurations

#### chromium, chromium\_trybot & chromium/orchestrator

The chromium family of recipes reads certain types of configuration from the
source tree.

##### Build system configuration

The gn configuration used by the chromium family of recipes is handled by
[MB][13]. MB's configuration is documented [here][14]. You only need to modify
it if your new builder will be compiling.

##### Test configuration

The test configuration used by the chromium family of recipes is in a group of
`.pyl` and derived `.json` files in `//testing/buildbot`. The format is
described [here][15].

##### Builder configuration

The [chromium\_tests\_builder\_config][5] module now supports module properties
that can be used to specify the per-builder config as part of the builder's
properties. There is starlark code that handles setting the properties correctly
for capturing parent-child and mirroring relationships. Having the config
specified at the builder definition simplifies adding and maintaining builders
and removes the need to make a change to [chromium/tools/build][17]. Module
properties must be used for all related builders (triggered/triggering builders
and mirrored/mirroring builders).

For the old way of defining the builder config in the recipe see the section
titled "Recipe-based config".

###### CI builders

CI builders will specify the `builder_spec` argument which contains the same
information that a `BuilderSpec` defined in the recipe would, though not in the
same structure.

```starlark
ci.linux_builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
    bootstrap = True,
    builder_spec = builder_config.builder_spec(
        chromium_config = builder_config.chromium_config(
            config = "chromium",
            apply_configs = ["mb"],
            build_config = builder_config.build_config.RELEASE,
            target_bits = 64,
        ),
        gclient_config = builder_config.gclient_config(
            config = "chromium",
        ),
    ),
...
)
```

If the CI builder only runs tests and is triggered by another builder, it should
set `execution_mode` to `builder_config.execution_mode.TEST` and specify the
triggering builder in the `triggered_by` field. The triggered_by field must be
set and it must contain exactly 1 element that is a reference to a builder that
also defines a `builder_spec`.

```starlark
ci.linux_builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
    bootstrap = True,
    builder_spec = builder_config.builder_spec(
        execution_mode = builder_config.TEST,
        chromium_config = builder_config.execution_mode.chromium_config(
            config = "chromium",
            apply_configs = ["mb"],
            build_config = builder_config.build_config.RELEASE,
            target_bits = 64,
        ),
        gclient_config = builder_config.gclient_config(
            config = "chromium",
        ),
    ),
    triggered_by = ['ci/$PARENT_BUILDER_NAME'],
    ...
)
```

###### Try builders

Most try builders will mirror 1 or more CI builders, this is done by specifying
the `mirrors` argument.

```starlark
try_.chromium_linux_builder(
    name = '$BUILDER_NAME',
    bootstrap = True,
    mirrors = [
        'ci/$CI_BUILDER_NAME',
        'ci/$CI_TESTER_NAME',
    ],
)
```

Occasionally, a try builder will be needed that doesn't mirror any CI builders,
in this case the `builder_spec` argument is specified just as a CI builder
would.

### Branched builders

Active chromium branches have CI and CQ set up that is a subset of the
configuration for trunk. The exact subset depends on the stage of the branch
(beta/stable vs. a long-term channel). Most builders do not need to be branched;
on trunk we run tests for not-yet-supported features and configurations.
Generally, a builder should be branched if and only if one of the following is
true:

* The builder is a non-experimental try builder on the CQ (specifies a value for
  the `tryjob` argument that doesn't set `experiment_percentage`).
* The builder is a CI builder that is mirrored by a non-experimental try
  builders on the CQ.
* The builder is a CI builder that uploads build artifacts.

There are occasional exceptions where builders are or aren't branched such as
not branching a builder that runs tests on a very small set of machines: with
limited capacity, it would be overwhelmed with additional builds happening on
the branch.

## Recipe-based config

If for some reason you can't use the chromium\_tests\_builder\_config module
properties for defining your new builder, then you'll have to modify the recipe
itself. Such cases should be rare, please contact gbeaty@ if you think you have
such a use case.

Modifying the recipe involves making a change in the [chromium/tools/build][17]
repo. If the builder being added is a tester that will be triggered by an
existing builder, the change to the recipe should be made after defining the
builder in chromium/src. Otherwise, the change to the recipe should be made
before defining the builder in chromium/src.

To configure a chromium CI builder, you'll want to add a config block to the
file in [recipe\_modules/chromium\_tests\_builder\_config][5] corresponding to
your new builder's builder group. The format is somewhat in flux and is not very
consistent among the different builder groups, but something like this should
suffice:

``` py
'your-new-builder': builder_spec.BuilderSpec.create(
  chromium_config='chromium',
  gclient_config='chromium',
  chromium_apply_config=['mb', 'ninja_confirm_noop'],
  chromium_config_kwargs={
    'BUILD_CONFIG': 'Release', # or 'Debug', as appropriate
    'TARGET_BITS': 64, # or 32, for some mobile builders
  },
  simulation_platform='$PLATFORM',  # one of 'mac', 'win', or 'linux'

  # There are a variety of other options; most of them are unnecessary in most
  # cases. If you think one may be applicable, please reach out or ask your
  # reviewer.
)
```

For chromium try builders, you'll also want to set up mirroring.
You can do so by adding your new try builder to [trybots.py][21].

A typical entry will just reference the matching CI builder, e.g.:

``` py
TRYBOTS = try_spec.TryDatabase.create({
  # ...

  'tryserver.chromium.example': {
      # If you want to build and test the same targets as one
      # CI builder, you can just do this:
      'your-new-builder': try_spec.TrySpec.create_for_single_mirror(
          builder_group='chromium.example',
          buildername='your-new-builder',
      ),

      # If you want to build the same targets as one CI builder
      # but not test anything, you can do this:
      'your-new-compile-builder': try_spec.TrySpec.create_for_single_mirror(
          builder_group='chromium.example',
          buildername='your-new-builder',
          analyze_mode='compile',
      ),

      # If you want to build and test the same targets as a builder/tester
      # CI pair, you can do this:
      'your-new-tester': try_spec.TrySpec.create_for_single_mirror(
          builder_group='chromium.example',
          buildername='your-new-builder',
          tester='your-new-tester',
      ),

      # If you want to mirror multiple try bots, please reach out.
    },

  # ...
})
```
