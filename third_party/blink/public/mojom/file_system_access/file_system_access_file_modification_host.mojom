// Manages storage file modifications for a non-incognito file handle held by
// an AccessHandle of FileSystemAccess.
//
// This interface is used for non-incognito files only. In incognito mode, quota
// is fully managed in the browser process.
interface FileSystemAccessFileModificationHost {
  // Requests or releases storage capacity.
  //
  // This interface's consumer must only expand the file handle associated with
  // this host according to the capacity obtained from RequestCapacityChange().
  // Renderers that deviate from this requirement will be terminated.
  //
  // Positive deltas are requests for capacity increases. The implementation may
  // grant more or less capacity than requested, but it will never decrease
  // capacity when an increase is requested. In other words, if
  // `capacity_delta` > 0, `granted_capacity_delta` is guaranteed to be >= 0.
  //
  // Negative deltas are capacity releases. Releasing unavailable capacity is a
  // bad message. Subject to this constraint, capacity releases are guaranteed
  // to succeed. In other words, if `capacity_delta` < 0,
  // `granted_capacity_delta` is guaranteed to == `capacity_delta`.
  //
  // The synchronous method is needed as File System Access Access Handles
  // implement synchronous write operations.

  // storage/browser/file_system/ were bypassed.
  //
  // This is intentionally fire-and-forget, since SyncAccessHandle writes are
  // synchronous and requiring round-trip IPC to complete before synchronously
  // returning would be detrimental to performance.
