  assert_throws_dom: constructor should throw function "() => {\n    new TCPSocket("127.0.0.1", 53);\n  }" threw object "ReferenceError: TCPSocket is not defined" that is not a DOMException NotAllowedError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 0
[FAIL] UDPSocket disabled by permissions-policy
  assert_throws_dom: constructor should throw function "() => {\n    new UDPSocket({ remoteAddress: "127.0.0.1", remotePort: 53 });\n  }" threw object "ReferenceError: UDPSocket is not defined" that is not a DOMException NotAllowedError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 0
[FAIL] TCPServerSocket disabled by permissions-policy
