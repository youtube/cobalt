# The set of path prefixes that should be checked for unsafe pointer usage (see
# -Wunsafe-buffer-usage in Clang).
#
# ***
# Paths should be written as relative to the root of the source tree with
# unix-style path separators. Directory prefixes should end with `/`, such
# as `base/`.
# ***
#
# Lines that begin with `-` name path prefixes that will *not* be checked for
# unsafe-buffer-usage. They are known to do unsafe things and should be
# changed to use constructs like base::span or containers like base::HeapArray
# and std::vector instead. See https://crbug.com/40285824
#
# Lines that begin with `+` name path prefixes that have no unsafe-buffer-usage
# (or all such usage is annotated), and are protected against new unsafe pointer
# behaviour by the compiler.
#
# By default, all files are checked for unsafe-buffer-usage unless they are
# match a `-` path prefix line here. If a file matches both a `-` and `+` line,
# the `+` line takes precedence and the file will be checked.
#
# To opt individual files out of checks, place `#pragma allow_unsafe_buffers`
# anywhere in the (source or header) file, guarded by
# `#ifdef UNSAFE_BUFFERS_BUILD`. These pragmas represent the technical debt and
# security risk present in the file through unsafe pointer usage.
#
# ***
# Recommended process for removing a `-dir/` line from this file:
#
# 1. Remove the `-dir/` line from this paths file.
#    a. Possibly add some subdirectories if needed to reduce scope,
#       like `-dir/sub_dir/`.
# 2. Add `#pragma allow_unsafe_buffers` to every file in the directory that now
#    has a compilation error, with a TODO to the tracking bug for the
#    directory:
#    ```
#    #ifdef UNSAFE_BUFFERS_BUILD
#    // TODO(crbug.com/ABC): Remove this and convert code to safer constructs.
#    #pragma allow_unsafe_buffers
#    #endif
#    ```
# 3. Work through the files in the directory, converting pointers to spans, or
#    to owning containers like HeapArray and vector. Remove the pragmas from
#    the files when there is no unsafe pointer usage left in each one.
#
# See `docs/unsafe_buffers.md`.
