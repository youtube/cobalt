Alert group ({{ group.key.string_id() }}) was automatically merged into {{ canonical_group.key.string_id() }} because corresponding issues were marked as duplicates.

Dashboard will now post all updates about newly detected regressions to the canonical group issue.

This behavior is set up by subscription config. One of the anomalies in the group had auto merge allowed. See go/chromeperf-auto-triage#opt-into-auto-merge for more details.
