# Targets definitions

This directory contains target definitions used for configuring the targets and
tests that will be executed by builders in the chromium project that use the
chromium_tests recipe module for executing tests. This includes most builders
that build and run tests. Builders running PRESUBMIT.py tests and builders
running fuzz tests are not included.

## Files

* [basic_suites.star](./basic_suites.star) - This contains definitions of basic
  suites, which specify tests to include as well as optionally specify various
  details for those tests such as which test target to actually build and run,
  additional args that should be used or default swarming details. These suites
  can be referenced by compound suites in compound_suites.star, matrix compound
  suites in matrix_compound_suites.star or set as a test suite for a builder in
  [waterfalls.pyl][waterfalls.pyl].
* [compound_suites.star](./compound_suites.star) - This contains definitions of
  compound suites, which specify basic suites to collect into a larger suite.
  These suites can set as a test suite for a builder in
  [waterfalls.pyl][waterfalls.pyl].
* [matrix_compound_suites.star](./matrix_compound_suites.star) - This contains
  definitions of matrix compound suites, which specify basic suites to collect
  into a larger suite, optionally applying mixins to all the tests of a basic
  suite and/or expanding tests in a basic suite with one or more variants. For
  each suite where variants are specified, each test in the suite will generate
  a test spec for each variant with the variant applying modifications to the
  generated test spec. These suites can be set as a test suite for a builder in
  [waterfalls.pyl][waterfalls.pyl].
* [mixins.star](./mixins.star) - This contains definitions of mixins that can be
  used to modify the generated test specs. These mixins can be specified when
  defining the details of a test in a basic suite to modify that test, when
  configuring a basic suite in a matrix compound suite to modify all tests in
  that expansion of the basic suite or on a builder in
  [waterfalls.pyl][waterfalls.pyl] to modify all tests for the builder.
* [targets.star](./targets.star) - This contains definitions of the target
  "isolates", which maps the GN target name to the ninja target name and
  specifies other details that are used in the process of generating the targets
  spec files. These targets can be specified when defining the details of a test
  in a basic suite.
* [variants.star](./variants.star) - This contains definitions of variants,
  which allow for expanding a single test definition into multiple generated
  test specs and apply additional modifications to the generated test specs.
  They can be specified when configuring a basic suite in a matrix compound
  suite to expand all of the tests in the basic suite with each of the specified
  variants.
  * [cros-skylab-variants.json](./cros-skylab-variants.json),
    [lacros-version-skew-variants.json](./lacros-version-skew-variants.json) -
    These files are consumed by variants.star to define certain subsets of
    variants. Json files are used because they are auto-generated by builders
    running periodically and json is easily manipulated programatticaly.

## Tests in starlark

Currently, a migration is in process to enable tests for a builder to be
configured as part of the builder definition itself. In order to avoid having to
manually sync definitions in two locations/systems, some of the .pyl files in
//testing/buildbot that used to be hand-written are now generated from the
starlark definitions. Due to intentional design decisions in lucicfg, the files
generated from the //infra/config starlark can't be located outside of
//infra/config. Owing to angle using an exported copy of the //testing/buildbot
directory, those .pyl files must still exist in //testing/buildbot.

Because of those constraints, updating some of the .pyl files requires the
following process:

1. Modify starlark files

    | .pyl file | starlark file to edit |
    |-----------|-----------------------|
    |gn_isolate_map.pyl|targets.star|
    |mixins.pyl|mixin.star|
    |variants.pyl|variants.star|
    |test_suites.pyl (basic_suites entries)|basic_suites.star|
    |test_suites.pyl (compound_suites entries)|compound_suites.star|
    |test_suites.pyl (matrix_compound_suites entries)|matrix_compound_suites.star|

1. Regenerate the config by running [main.star](/infra/config/main.star)

    `lucicfg infra/config/main.star`

    On mac or linux, you can just do: `infra/config/main.star`

1. Copy the pyl files from //infra/config/generated/testing to
   //testing/buildbot by running
   [sync-pyl-files.py](/infra/config/scripts/sync-pyl-files.py)

    `infra/config/scripts/sync-pyl-files.py`

Then you can make any edits you wish to the hand-written .pyl files in
//testing/buildbot ([waterfalls.pyl][waterfalls.pyl] and
[test_suite_exceptions.pyl](/testing/buildbot/test_suite_exceptions.pyl)) and
run [generate_buildbot_json.py](/testing/buildbot/generate_buildbot_json.py) to
generate the targets spec files.

[waterfalls.pyl]: /testing/buildbot/waterfalls.pyl
