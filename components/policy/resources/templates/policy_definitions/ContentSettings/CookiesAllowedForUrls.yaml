caption: Allow cookies on these sites
desc: |-
  Allows you to set a list of url patterns that specify sites which are allowed to set cookies.

            If this policy is left not set the global default value will be used for all sites either from the <ph name="DEFAULT_COOKIES_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">DefaultCookiesSetting</ph> policy if it is set, or the user's personal configuration otherwise.

            See also policies <ph name="COOKIES_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">CookiesBlockedForUrls</ph> and <ph name="COOKIES_SESSIONS_ONLY_FOR_URLS">CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls</ph>. Note that there must be no conflicting URL patterns between these three policies - it is unspecified which policy takes precedence.

            For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph> is not an accepted value for this policy.
