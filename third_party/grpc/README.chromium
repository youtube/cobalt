Steps to upgrade to a new version of GRPC, all relative to //third_party/grpc:
1. Update revision, version and CPEPrefix in this file. The version can be
   found in the root BUILD file in gRPC repo.
2. Run third_party/grpc/update.sh.
3. Update the BUILD.gn file. ./generate_gn.sh is a script that tries to
   do it but it's half-broken (it gets third_party targets wrong). It
   might still be useful as a baseline. To run it, make sure the
   mako_templates python module is installed ("apt-get install
   python3-mako"). See https://crbug.com/405054271 for a proposal on how
   to make this step easier in the future.

Note: Please also remember to check if `plugin_registry/grpc_plugin_registry.cc`
needs update! Upstream sometimes introduces new plugins in
`/source/src/core/plugin_registry/grpc_plugin_registry.cc` and we may need to update
our custom `grpc_plugin_registry.cc`.
