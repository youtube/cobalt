desc: "When enabled the <ph name=\"PRODUCT_NAME\">IntensiveWakeUpThrottling</ph> feature\
  \ causes JavaScript timers in background tabs to be aggressively throttled and coalesced,\
  \ running no more than once per minute after a page has been backgrounded for 5\
  \ minutes or more.\n\n          This is a web standards compliant feature, but it\
  \ may break functionality\n          on some websites by causing certain actions\
  \ to be delayed by up to a\n          minute. However, it results in significant\
  \ CPU and battery savings when\n          enabled. See https://bit.ly/30b1XR4 for\
  \ more details.\n\n          If this policy is set to enabled then the feature will\
  \ be force enabled, and\n          users will not be able to override this.\n\n\
  \          If this policy is set to disabled then the feature will be force disabled,\
  \ and\n          users will not be able to override this.\n\n          If this policy\
  \ is left unset then the feature will be controlled by its\n          own internal\
  \ logic, which can be manually configured by users.\n\n          Note that the policy\
  \ is applied per renderer process, with the most recent\n          value of the\
  \ policy setting in force when a renderer process starts. A full\n          restart\
  \ is required to ensure that all loaded tabs receive a consistent\n          policy\
  \ setting. It is harmless for processes to be running with different\n         \
  \ values of this policy.\n          "
