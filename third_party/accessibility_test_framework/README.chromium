Description:
Library that contains accessibility-related checks for Android View and
AccessibilityNodeInfo objects.
Local Modifications:
 - Added proguard.flags to suppress warnings about this library using protobuf
   instead of protolite.
 - AccessibilityCheckResult has had the deprecated AccessibilityCheckResultDescriptor restored into
   it as it moved locations in 4.0.
 - AccessibilityValidator has had an ImmutableList return type casting added. It also removed usage
   of deprecatedResultDescriptor so that the types to AccessibilityViewCheckException would match
   the usage in 4.0.
