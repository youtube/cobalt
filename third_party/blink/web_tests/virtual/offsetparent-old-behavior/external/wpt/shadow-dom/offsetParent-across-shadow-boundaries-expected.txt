PASS offsetParent must return null on a child element of a shadow host for the shadow tree in open mode which is not assigned to any slot
PASS offsetParent must return null on a child element of a shadow host for the shadow tree in closed mode which is not assigned to any slot
PASS offsetParent must return null on a child element of a shadow host for the shadow tree in open mode which is not in the flat tree
