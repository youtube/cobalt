caption: External authentication app launch URLs
desc: "Allows you to specify configs for authentication urls in <ph name=\"WEBVIEW_PRODUCT_NAME\"\
  >Android WebView</ph>.\n\n      These Authentication urls would be treated special\
  \ by <ph name=\"WEBVIEW_PRODUCT_NAME\">Android WebView</ph>, such that during authentication\
  \ when webpage in <ph name=\"WEBVIEW_PRODUCT_NAME\">Android WebView</ph>\n     \
  \ is navigated to authentication urls, corresponding Identity providers authenticator\
  \ app that can handle this authentication URL would be launched.\n\n      This flow\
  \ of launching the Identity providers authenticator app would be used by the Identity\
  \ providers to enable\n      use cases like providing SSO across apps or provide\
  \ better security by collecting zero trust device signals to understand device posture\
  \ during authentication.\n\n      If there is no valid app installed to handle authentication\
  \ url on the device, navigation will continue in <ph name=\"WEBVIEW_PRODUCT_NAME\"\
  >Android WebView</ph>.\n\n      Authentication URL pattern has to be formatted according\
  \ to https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format.\n      "
