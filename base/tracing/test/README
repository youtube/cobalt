# PerfettoSQL Chrome Standard Library tests

This directory contains the [Perfetto Diff Tests](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor#diff-tests) to test changes to the Chrome standard library.

The diff tests themselves are in `./trace_processor/diff_tests/chrome`. The `./data` directory contains the Perfetto traces that are used by the diff tests.

## Running Diff Tests

Currently, the diff tests only run on Linux. You can build and run the diff tests with the following.

```
$ gn gen --args='' out/Linux
$ autoninja -C out/Linux perfetto_diff_tests
$ out/Linux/bin/run_perfetto_diff_tests
```
