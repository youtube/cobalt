This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] moveBefore should not reset selection with preceding text
  assert_equals: expected Text node "This text does not move" but got Text node "Text"
[FAIL] moveBefore resets selection that enters a subtree, when the whole selection is moved
  assert_equals: expected Text node "Grandparent paragraph" but got Text node "Parent paragraph"
[FAIL] moveBefore anchor node moved up to expand selection and absorb nodes
  assert_equals: expected Text node "Child paragraph one" but got Text node "Parent paragraph"
[FAIL] moveBefore focus node moved up to shrink selection and exclude nodes; focus node gets reset
  assert_equals: expected Text node "Parent paragraph" but got Text node "Paragraph two"
[FAIL] moveBefore selection is not preserved, especially when underlying range gets inverted
  assert_equals: expected Text node "Three" but got Text node "Four"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
