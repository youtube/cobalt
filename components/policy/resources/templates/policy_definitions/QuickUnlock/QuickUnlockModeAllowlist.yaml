caption: Configure allowed quick unlock modes
default_for_enterprise_users: []
desc: |-
  Setting the policy controls which quick unlock modes can unlock the lock screen.

        To allow:

        * Every quick unlock mode, use ["all"] (includes modes added in the future).

        * Only PIN unlock, use ["PIN"].

        * PIN and fingerprint, use ["PIN", "FINGERPRINT"].

        If the policy is unset or set to an empty list, no quick unlock modes are available for managed devices.
