caption: Enable support for the PPB_VideoDecoder(Dev) API.
desc: |-
  This policy can be temporarily used to force-enable support for the
  PPB_VideoDecoder(Dev) API.

  When the policy is left unset or set to Disabled, the browser will decide whether
  the API is supported.
  When the policy is set to Enabled, the API will be supported.

  This policy can be used in case our ongoing elimination of support for this API
  exposes problems. If you must use the policy, please file a bug on crbug.com
  explaining your use case and CC {blundell, vasilyt}@chromium.org. The policy is
  available through <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>
  version 114, after which support for this API was eliminated unconditionally.

  NOTE: Only newly-started renderer processes will reflect changes to this
  policy while the browser is running.
