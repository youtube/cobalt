## Quick note how to review license-related changes in `readme.rs`

For changes that add support for a new license kind, please get a review from
chromium-third-party@google.com (as documented in
`//docs/adding_to_third_party.md` - see
[a link to an old revision of that doc here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:docs/adding_to_third_party.md;l=396-403;drc=933b35e0c349c6e813dbf9d6ff98ecb4428466ab)

For benign changes (e.g.
[adding](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5773797/2/tools/crates/gnrt/lib/readme.rs)
a new free-form spelling of "MIT or Apache-2")
there is no need for any additional review.
