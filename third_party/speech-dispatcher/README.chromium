Only the libspeechd.h (and dependent) files are imported, as the client library
(libspeechd.so.2) is dynamically loaded (where present).

These headers are imported because later versions of Speech Dispatcher (>= 0.8)
install it into a different location (${includedir}/speech-dispatcher instead of
${includedir}) and we still need to support older versions.

libspeechd_version is not imported as it is generated upstream
(libspeechd_version.h.in) and does not appear necessary for library loading.
