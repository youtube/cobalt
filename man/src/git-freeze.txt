git-freeze(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-freeze -
include::_git-freeze_desc.helper.txt[]

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git freeze'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`git freeze` works a lot like `git stash`, in that it stores the current changes
in your working copy and index 'somewhere'. Unlike `git stash`, `git freeze`
stores those changes on your current branch. This effectively allows you to
'pause' development of a branch, work on something else, and then come back to
exactly the same working state later (by running `git thaw`).

`git freeze` will make up to 2 commits on your branch. A commit with the message
`FREEZE.indexed` will contain all changes which youâ€™ve added to your index (like
with 'git add', 'git mv', 'git rm', etc.). A commit with the message
`FREEZE.unindexed` will contain all changes which were not in your index at the
time you ran git freeze (freshly modified files, new files, etc.).

By default `git freeze` will only freeze up to 100MB of untracked files. See
'CONFIGURATION VARIABLES' for more details.


EXAMPLE
-------
demo:1[]


CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
-----------------------

depot-tools.freeze-size-limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This sets the size limit as an integer number of megabytes of untracked files
that git-freeze will be willing to put in suspended animation. A 0 or negative
limit disables the size-limit check entirely. *100* by default.
