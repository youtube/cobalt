/**
 * Manage multiple SurfaceViews for the compositor, so that transitions between
 * surfaces with and without an alpha channel can be visually smooth.
 *
 * This class allows a client to request a 'translucent' or 'opaque' surface, and we will signal via
 * SurfaceHolder.Callback when it's ready.  We guarantee that the client will receive surfaceCreated
 * / surfaceDestroyed only for a surface that represents the most recently requested PixelFormat.
 *
 * Internally, we maintain two SurfaceViews, since calling setFormat() to change the PixelFormat
 * results in a visual glitch as the surface is torn down.  crbug.com/679902
 *
 * The client has the responsibility to call doneWithUnownedSurface() at some point between when we
 * call back its surfaceCreated, when it is safe for us to hide the SurfaceView with the wrong
 * format.  It is okay if it requests multiple surfaces without calling doneWithUnownedSurface.
 *
 * If the client requests the same format more than once in a row, it will still receive destroyed /
 * created / changed messages for it, even though we won't tear it down.
 *
 * The full design doc is at https://goo.gl/aAmQzR .
