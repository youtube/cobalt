  Setting the policy to Enabled prevents webpage elements that aren't from the domain that's in the browser's address bar from setting cookies. Setting the policy to Disabled lets those elements set cookies and prevents users from changing this setting.

        Leaving it unset turns third-party cookies on, but users can change this setting.
