default: null
desc: |-
    Controls the touch virtual keyboard on the login screen, acting as a supplementary policy to the <ph name="VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeviceLoginScreenVirtualKeyboardEnabled</ph> policy.

        If accessibility virtual keyboard is turned on, this policy has no effect.

        Otherwise, this policy has the following effect on the login screen:
        If this policy is not set, the virtual keyboard is displayed based on the default system heuristics, such as whether there are keyboards attached.
        If this policy is set to True, the virtual keyboard is always displayed.
        If this policy is set to False, the virtual keyboard is never displayed.

        The virtual keyboard may change to a compact layout depending on the input method.
