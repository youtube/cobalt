This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS dispatchEvent triggers listener added with addListener
PASS listener added with addListener and addEventListener is called once
PASS listener added with addListener and addEventListener (capture) is called twice
PASS removeEventListener removes listener added with addListener
PASS removeEventListener (capture) doesn't remove listener added with addListener
PASS removeListener removes listener added with addEventListener
PASS removeListener doesn't remove listener added with addEventListener (capture)
FAIL capturing event listener fires before non-capturing listener at target assert_array_equals: triggerMQLEvent expected property 0 to be "addEventListener" but got "addListener" (expected array ["addEventListener", "addListener"] got ["addListener", "addEventListener"])
Harness: the test ran to completion.
