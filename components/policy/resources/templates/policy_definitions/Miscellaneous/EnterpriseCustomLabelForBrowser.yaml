  This policy controls a custom label used to indicate a managed browser. For managed browsers, this label will be shown in a management disclaimer on a footer on the New Tab page. The custom label will not be translated.

  Note that this policy is only applied for managed browsers, so it will have no effect for managed users on unmanaged browsers.
