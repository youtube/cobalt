caption: Configure the list of domains on which Safe Browsing will not trigger warnings.
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy is deprecated, please use <ph name="SAFE_BROWSING_ALLOWLIST_DOMAINS_POLICY_NAME">SafeBrowsingAllowlistDomains</ph> instead.

        Setting the policy to Enabled means Safe Browsing will trust the domains you designate. It won't check them for dangerous resources such as phishing, malware, or unwanted software. Safe Browsing's download protection service won't check downloads hosted on these domains. Its password protection service won't check for password reuse.

        Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means default Safe Browsing protection applies to all resources.

         On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft速 Windows速</ph>, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft速 Active Directory速</ph> domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Browser Cloud Management</ph>. On <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph>, this functionality is only available on instances that are managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.
