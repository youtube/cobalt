This directory contains components use to build an autoconf-ready package
of the SQLite amalgamation:  sqlite-autoconf-30XXXXXX.tar.gz

To build the autoconf amalgamation, run from the top-level:

   ./configure
   make amalgamation-tarball

The amalgamation-tarball target (also available in "main.mk") runs the
script tool/mkautoconfamal.sh which does the work.  Refer to that script
for details.
