/**
 * A table containing (full) pointers to TrustedObjects.
 *
 * When the sandbox is enabled, a trusted pointer table (TPT) is used to safely
 * reference trusted heap objects located in one of the trusted spaces outside
 * of the sandbox. The TPT guarantees that every access to an object via a
 * trusted pointer (an index into the table) either results in an invalid
 * pointer or a valid pointer to a valid (live) object of the expected type.
 *
 * The TPT is very similar to the external pointer table (EPT), but is used to
 * reference V8 HeapObjects (located inside a V8 heap) rather than C++ objects
 * (typically located on one of the system heaps). As such, the garbage
 * collector needs to be aware of the table indirection.
