caption: Control automatic cleanup during login
default: false
desc: |-
  When this policy is set to true, automatic cleanup is executed during login to ensure enough free disk space is available.
        Cleanup will only run when strictly necessary, but will still impact the login time.
        Setting the policy to false (the default) ensures the login time is not affected.
