caption: Configuring the ToS behavior during first-run for CCT
default: 1
desc: |-
  By default the Terms of Service are shown when CCT is first-run. Setting this policy to <ph name="SKIP_TOS_DIALOG">SkipTosDialog</ph> will cause the Terms of Service dialog to not appear during the first-run-experience or subsequent runs. Setting this policy to <ph name="STANDARD_TOS_DIALOG">StandardTosDialog</ph> or leaving it unset will cause the Terms of Service dialog to appear during the first-run-experience. The other caveats are:

        - This policy only works on fully managed Android devices that can be configured by Unified Endpoint Management vendors.

        - If this policy is <ph name="SKIP_TOS_DIALOG">SkipTosDialog</ph> the BrowserSignin policy will have no effect.

        - If this policy is <ph name="SKIP_TOS_DIALOG">SkipTosDialog</ph> metricsâ€‹ will not be sent to the server.

        - If this policy is <ph name="SKIP_TOS_DIALOG">SkipTosDialog</ph> the browser will have limited functionality.

        - If this policy is <ph name="SKIP_TOS_DIALOG">SkipTosDialog</ph> admins must communicate this to end users of the device.
