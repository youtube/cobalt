caption: Allow HTTPS-Only Mode to be enabled
default: allowed
desc: |-
  This policy controls whether users can enable HTTPS-Only Mode (Always Use Secure Connections) in Settings. HTTPS-Only Mode upgrades all navigations to HTTPS.
        If this setting is not set or set to allowed, users will be allowed to enable HTTPS-Only Mode.
        If this setting is set to disallowed, users will not be allowed to enable HTTPS-Only Mode.
        If this setting is set to force_enabled, HTTPS-Only Mode will be enabled in Strict mode and users will not be able to disable it.
        If this setting is set to force_balanced_enabled, HTTPS-Only Mode will be enabled in Balanced mode and users will not be able to disable it.
        force_enabled is supported from M112 onwards, force_balanced_enabled is supported from M129 onwards.
        If you set this policy to a value that is not supported by the version of Chrome that receives the policy, Chrome will default to the allowed setting.

  The separate <ph name="HTTP_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">HttpAllowlist</ph> policy
  can be used to exempt specific hostnames or hostname patterns from being
  upgraded to HTTPS by this feature.
