// TouchExplorationController is used in tandem with "Spoken Feedback" to
// make the touch UI accessible. Gestures performed in the middle of the screen
// are mapped to accessibility key shortcuts while gestures performed on the
// edge of the screen can change settings.
//
// ** Short version **
//
// At a high-level, single-finger events are used for accessibility -
// exploring the screen gets turned into touch explore gestures (which can then
// be hit tested by an accessibility service running, result then to be spoken),
// a single tap while the user is in touch exploration or a double-tap simulates
// a click, and gestures can be used to send high-level accessibility commands.
// For example, a swipe right would correspond to the keyboard short cut
// shift+search+right. Swipes with up to four fingers are also mapped to
// commands. Slide gestures performed on the edge of the screen can change
// settings continuously. For example, sliding a finger along the right side of
// the screen will change the volume. When a user double taps and holds with one
// finger, the finger is passed through as if accessibility was turned off. If
// the user taps the screen with two fingers, the user can silence spoken
// feedback if it is playing.
//
// ** Long version **
//
// Here are the details of the implementation:
//
// When the first touch is pressed, a 300 ms grace period timer starts.
//
// If the user keeps their finger down for more than 300 ms and doesn't
// perform a supported accessibility gesture in that time (e.g. swipe right),
// they enter touch exploration mode, and all movements are routed
// to ChromeVox with the touch location.
//
// Also, if the user moves their single finger outside a certain slop region
// (without performing a gesture), they enter touch exploration mode earlier
// than 300 ms.
//
// If the user taps and releases their finger, after 300 ms from the initial
// touch, a single touch explore gesture is fired.
//
// The user can perform swipe gestures in one of the four cardinal directions
// which will be interpreted and used to control the UI. All gestures will only
// be registered if the fingers move outside the slop, and all fingers will only
// be registered if they are completed within the grace period. If a single
// finger gesture fails to be completed within the grace period, the state
// changes to touch exploration mode. If a multi finger gesture fails to be
// completed within the grace period, the user must lift all fingers before
// completing any more actions.
//
// The user's initial tap sets the anchor point. Simulated events are
// positioned relative to the anchor point, so that after exploring to find
// an object the user can double-tap anywhere on the screen to activate it.
// The anchor point is also set by ChromeVox every time it highlights an
// object on the screen. During touch exploration this ensures that
// any simulated events go to the center of the most recently highlighted
// object, rather than to the exact tap location (which could have drifted
// off of the object). This also ensures that when the current ChromeVox
// object changes due to a gesture or input focus changing, simulated
// events go to that object and not the last location touched by a finger.
//
// When the user double-taps, this is treated as a discrete gestures, and
// and event is sent to ChromeVox to activate the current object, whatever
// that is. However, when the user double-taps and holds, any event from that
// finger is passed through, allowing the user to drag. These events are
// passed through with a location that's relative to the anchor point.
//
// If any other fingers are added or removed during a passthrough, they are
// ignored. Once the passthrough finger is released, passthrough stops and
// the state is reset to the no fingers down state.
//
// If the user enters touch exploration mode, they can click without lifting
// their touch exploration finger by tapping anywhere else on the screen with
// a second finger, while the touch exploration finger is still pressed.
//
// Once touch exploration mode has been activated, it remains in that mode until
// all fingers have been released.
//
// If the user places a finger on the edge of the screen and moves their finger
// past slop, a slide gesture is performed. The user can then slide one finger
// along an edge of the screen and continuously control a setting. Once the user
// enters this state, the boundaries that define an edge expand so that the user
// can now adjust the setting within a slightly bigger width along the screen.
// If the user exits this area without lifting their finger, they will not be
// able to perform any actions, however if they keep their finger down and
// return to the "hot edge," then they can still adjust the setting. In order to
// perform other touch accessibility movements, the user must lift their finger.
// If additional fingers are added while in this state, the user will transition
// to passthrough.
//
// Currently, only the right edge is mapped to control the volume. Volume
// control along the edge of the screen is directly proportional to where the
// user's finger is located on the screen. The top right corner of the screen
// automatically sets the volume to 100% and the bottome right corner of the
// screen automatically sets the volume to 0% once the user has moved past slop.
//
// If the user taps the screen with two fingers and lifts both fingers before
// the grace period has passed, spoken feedback is silenced.
//
// The user can also enter passthrough by placing a finger on one of the bottom
// corners of the screen until an earcon sounds. After the earcon sounds, the
// user is in passthrough so all subsequent fingers placed on the screen will be
// passed through. Once the finger in the corner has been released, the state
// will switch to wait for no fingers.
//
// The caller is expected to retain ownership of instances of this class and
// destroy them before |root_window| is destroyed.
