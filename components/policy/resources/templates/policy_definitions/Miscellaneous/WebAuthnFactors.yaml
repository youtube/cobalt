caption: Configure allowed WebAuthn factors
desc: |-
  Setting the policy controls which WebAuthn factors can be used.

        To allow:

        * Every WebAuthn factor, use ["all"] (includes factors added in the future).

        * Only PIN, use ["PIN"].

        * PIN and fingerprint, use ["PIN", "FINGERPRINT"].

        If the policy is unset or set to an empty list, no WebAuthn factors are available for managed devices.
