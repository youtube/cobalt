  <summary>
    The battery percentage of the system when the AC charger is unplugged. This
    metric is recorded upon unplug of an AC charger, unless the system is
    shutdown. Since this metric is only reported when the battery percentage has
    reached the hold percent (the battery charge % that charging is delayed at,
    which is 80%) for Adaptive Charging, most values should be high.

    We record this under several variants, which split this result by the type
    of charging that is used to charge to full once the hold percent is reached.
    Normal charging uses the default rate of charging, slow charging uses a
    battery charge current limit of 0.1C (10% of battery design capacity) and
    mixed charging is a combination of both normal and slow charging which can
    occur when the unplug time prediction moves sooner, resulting in the switch
    from slow charging to normal charging in order to finish charging by the
    unplug time predicted.

    The difference between the correct delay time and the actual delay time for

    Adaptive Charging delays charging from a hold charge percentage, 80%, to
    full if it predicts the charger will be unplugged more than 3 hours in the
    future. The correct delay time ends exactly 3 hours before the user unplugs
    the charger, or 2 hours before the user unplugs if the available time is
    less than 3 hours. This metric is recorded upon unplug of an AC charger, if
    the hold percent was reached.

    We record this under several variants, which split this result by whether
    Adaptive Charging is enabled and active, a heuristic disabled the feature,
    the user canceled the feature for this use, the user disabled the feature,
    or the feature is not supported on the hardware class. We still record the
    metric if the feature is not supported, since we may backport support to
    older systems, and we'd like to know how well the ML model does before

    Periodically samples the battery capacity drained while Chrome is a
    foreground app and the device is on battery power {DarkeningType}. Sampled
    every 30 seconds while foregrounded. Also sampled when Chrome is
    backgrounded or the device connects to a charger. {Exclusive}

    Sample values are reported in microampere-hours and averaged over successive
    sampling points without a change in capacity counter values. Since the
    capacity counter resolution differs between device models, averaging the
    values allows us to make comparisons between frequent small capacity drops
    and infrequent large drops. For example, a 20,000 uAh drop over two
    successive periods of 30 seconds will be reported as two samples of 10,000
    uAh.

    For more details, see http://bit.ly/chrome-android-foreground-battery-drain.

    Only supported on Android. For WebView, the metric considers the time during
    in which at least one WebView is visible on the screen as
    &quot;foreground&quot; time. For Chrome, it considers any time the Chrome
    app is visible, including when in multi-window mode.

    Note that the capacity counter can be implemented in different ways by
    different devices/OEMs and its accuracy can vary (across devices and at
    different times on the same device, also due to environmental factors like
    device temperature or charge level).

    We've found looking at the 99%ile-trimmed mean more useful than looking at
    specific percentiles, especially when filtering for specific device models.

    This histogram is of special interest to the chrome-analysis-team@. Do not
    change its semantics or retire it without talking to them first.

    while foregrounded. Also sampled when Chrome is backgrounded or the device
    connects to a charger. {Exclusive}

    Sample values are reported as provided by the battery capacity counter (in
    microampere-hours). Because the resolution of this counter is rather coarse
    (usually between 500 and 50,000 uAh), the uAh value may have been drained
    over a longer time period than 30 seconds. See also
    Power.ForegroundBatteryDrain.30SecondsAvg, which averages the values over
    successive sampling points without change in counter values.
