    Logged whenever history database initialization fails. The frequency of
    logging will tell you the total failure rate. True indicate that we think
    the database is non-recoverable and it will be deleted. It should be
    re-created the next time Chrome is started. False indicates we think the
    error is temporary (like out of disk space or file locked). Chrome will run
    with no history database and nothing will be done to try to fix the error.

    This histogram records the total time taken to convert and process visits in
    all history cluster available. This is recorded once after the conversion,
    deduplication and sorting of the clusters. This is recorded using the
    highest precision clock possible. Like most time measurements this will not
    have the same behavior regarding system sleep on all platforms. See
    bit.ly/chrome-clocks-and-sleep for more details. Since the measurement is
    taken after the operation is over it will be missing if the operation never
    completes. This can happen if the user or the system shuts down chrome
    because of the unresponsiveness. A decidedly imperfect strategy to evaluate
    how often this happens is to compare total counts with another histogram
    that is recorded before the operation starts
    (&quot;History.Clusters.Backend.GetClusterLatency&quot;). Such analysis has
    to be conducted with care. Consult with Metrics team if curious.

    Records the time taken between the History Clusters UI requests a batch of
    clusters, and when we get the post-processed clusters back.

    This request occurs when the page is first loaded, when the page is
    refreshed, when the user changes the History search terms, and when the user
    scrolls to the bottom of the page and requests the next batch of clusters
    from the service.

    This metric doesn't distinguish between any of these cases. This metric is
    recorded on all requests, whether or not it returns clusters.

    This does not take into account the time spent in JavaScript, or updating
    the DOM. It's recorded in QueryClustersState, which is meant to be shared
    between multiple UIs.

    Roughly, History.Clusters.ServiceLatency =
