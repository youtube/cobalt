This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Sanitizer interface: operation sanitize((DocumentFragment or Document))
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "sanitize" missing
[FAIL] Sanitizer interface: new Sanitizer({}) must inherit property "sanitize((DocumentFragment or Document))" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "sanitize" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Sanitizer interface: calling sanitize((DocumentFragment or Document)) on new Sanitizer({}) with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_inherits: property "sanitize" not found in prototype chain
