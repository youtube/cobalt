//
// Subclasses provide interface to use the image fetcher (as this differs per
// platform) and can specialize handling the returned image.
//
// On Desktop and iOS:
// 1. AutofillImageFetcher (in components/) extends this class, and implements
// the logic to fetch images.
// 2. AutofillImageFetcherImpl (in chrome/) extends AutofillImageFetcher, and is
// responsible for initializing and exposing the image_fetcher::ImageFetcher to
// the components/ directory.
//
// On Android:
// AutofillImageFetcherImpl (in chrome/) extends this class, and is responsible
// for initializing and storing a reference to the Java AutofillImageFetcher.
// Since fetching, treating, and caching of images is done on the Java layer,
// Android does not need an intermediate class.
