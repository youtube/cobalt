This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] All properties (except 'all') can serialize their initial value (computed)
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid", "none / none / none / row / auto / auto"], ["page-orientation", ""], ["popover-hide-delay", "infinity * 1s"], ["size", ""]] length 4
[FAIL] All shorthands (except 'all') can serialize their longhands set to their initial value
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["border", ""]] length 1
