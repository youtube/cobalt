 * @summary Buttons help people take action, such as sending an email, sharing a
 * document, or liking a comment.

 * @description
 * __Emphasis:__ Medium emphasis – For important actions that don’t distract
 * from other onscreen elements.
 *
 * __Rationale:__ Use an outlined button for actions that need attention but
 * aren’t the primary action, such as “See all” or “Add to cart.” This is also
 * the button to use for giving someone the opportunity to change their mind or
 * escape a flow.
 *
 * __Example usages:__
 * - Reply
 * - View all
 * - Add to cart
 * - Take out of trash
 *
 * @final
 * @suppress {visibility}
