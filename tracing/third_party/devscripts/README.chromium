Description:
This directory contains selected tools from the Debian's devscripts collection.

A .vanilla file is checked in so that our patched version can be easily
compared with the unpatched script (e.g. when sending the changes upstream).
Having a .patch file checked in was too inconvenient to keep up to date.
