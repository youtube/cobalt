# TODO(b/313073098): Deprecate policy.
desc: |-
  This policy is provided as a way to opt-out of the First-Party Sets feature.

  When this policy is unset or set to Enabled, the First-Party Sets feature is enabled.

  When this policy is set to Disabled, the First-Party Sets feature is disabled.

  It controls whether Chrome supports First-Party Sets related integrations.

  This is the equivalent of the <ph name="RELATED_WEBSITE_SETS_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">RelatedWebsiteSetsEnabled</ph> policy.
  Either policy may be used, but this one will be deprecated soon so the <ph name="RELATED_WEBSITE_SETS_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">RelatedWebsiteSetsEnabled</ph> policy is preferred.
  They both have the same effect on the browser's behavior.
