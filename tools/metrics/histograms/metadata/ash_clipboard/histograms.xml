  <summary>
    The number of consecutive pastes from the clipboard history menu in the user
    session. Recorded at the time of a copy or a paste that is not through the
    clipboard history menu, such as pressing Ctrl+V or using a context menu's
    Paste option.

  <summary>
    The data format of an item deleted from the clipboard history menu. Recorded
    when the user deletes an item.

    Note: Prior to M112, this histogram erroneously recorded two samples when an
    item was deleted by clicking the delete button. Deleting an item using the
    Backspace key correctly recorded one sample.

  <summary>
    The data format of an item pasted from the clipboard history menu. Recorded
    when the user pastes an item.

    Note: Prior to M112, this histogram erroneously recorded samples only when
    an item was pasted by clicking or pressing Enter with an item selected.
    Other methods of pasting, such as toggling the menu closed or using the
    virtual keyboard, were not counted at all.

  <summary>
    The time between a user's Ctrl key press and the user's V key press when
    pasting via keyboard. Recorded when V is pressed. Only recorded for the
    first V press in a sequence. Sample scenario: User holds Ctrl, waits 200ms,
    presses V (histogram entry recorded), and presses V again without releasing
    Ctrl (no histogram entry recorded).

    Note: Version 1 of this histogram incorrectly recorded the Ctrl pressed time
    in some cases such that it seemed closer to the V pressed time than it
    really was. This histogram's entries are more accurate.

  <summary>
    The lifetime of a request created by the clipboard image model factory. This
    factory reuses one request object for disinct logical requests until no new
    rendering requests are issued for some period of time, at which point the
    request object is deemed idle and destroyed. Recorded when a request object
    is destroyed, either because it was idle or the system is shutting down.

  <summary>
    The number of times the clipboard history {NudgeType} has been shown.
    Recorded when the {NudgeType} is shown.

    This histogram can be used in conjunction with the ToFeatureOpen and
    ToFeaturePaste histograms to understand a nudge's efficacy in getting users
    to engage with the feature.

  <summary>
    The delay between the user being shown the clipboard history {NudgeType} and
    the user's {Action} action. Recorded at the time of the {Action}.

    Note: Version 1 of this histogram counted opening the clipboard history menu
    via context menu as an &quot;open&quot; action. However, the nudges suggest
    opening clipboard history via accelerator; they do not mention a context
    menu option. This histogram only records opens that the nudge may have
    actually led to.

    enum="ClipboardHistoryOperation" expires_after="2024-03-17">
  <owner>ckincaid@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>multipaste@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    An operation such as a copy or paste detected by clipboard history. Recorded
    after any duplicate clipboard operations are debounced in clipboard history.

    The total number of copies and pastes in this histogram differ from the
    Clipboard.Write and Clipboard.Read histograms, respectively, because
    clipboard history debounces operations before emitting to this histogram. As
    a result, clipboard history avoids recording programmatic clipboard reads
    and writes that do not correspond to user actions.

    Warning: This histogram was expired from 2022-01-02 to 2022-01-05; data may
    be missing.
