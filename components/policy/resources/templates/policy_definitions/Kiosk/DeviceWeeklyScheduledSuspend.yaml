caption: Schedule weekly suspend intervals
desc: |-
  This policy establishes a series of weekly intervals for scheduling automated suspension. When an interval starts, the <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> device will enter suspend mode, and wake up when the interval ends.

  Schedules with overlapping intervals are not supported. This policy will not have any effect if it contains any two overlapping intervals.

  <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> devices will use the system timezone to apply these intervals.

  Important Note: The schedules set by this policy may not occur as expected if they conflict with other power management settings, such as <ph name="POWER_MANAGEMENT_IDLE_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">PowerManagementIdleSettings</ph>. Ensure these settings are configured to allow the scheduled suspend intervals to take effect.
