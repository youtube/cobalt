# These owners approve changes to content_shell.filter
#
# The point of this list of owners is just to make sure there is specific review
# for changes made to content_shell.filter, so that changes aren't made without
# an understanding of the implications. If there is a good reason for a change,
# it should be approved.
#
# Specific guidelines for *new tests* being added:
# - Newly-created web platform tests should *not* be added to the
#   content_shell.filter file. Tests run in headless shell by default, or can be
#   made to run in full chrome with chrome.filter. WPT tests are expected to
#   pass in normal chrome builds and so should not be built to depend on
#   content_shell behavior.
#
# - New tests that for whatever reason *cannot* be made compatible with
#   headless or chrome (e.g. due to missing test infra or something) can also be
#   added to this list. Note that this doesn't include new tests that are flaky
#   for unknown reasons - an attempt should be made to identify the source of
#   the flakiness and address it, rather than simply adding it to the
#   content_shell.filter file.
#
# Specific guidelines for *existing tests*:
#
# - If a test becomes flaky, one key thing to check is whether it became flaky
#   as the result of starting to be run with the headless/chrome test infra. If
#   so, it is a likely candidate for addition to content_shell.filter, because
#   the flakiness was *triggered* by the switch to headless. On the other hand,
#   if it has been running via headless all along, and then became flaky, then
#   the root cause is something else, and the test should be marked in
#   TestExpectations instead.
