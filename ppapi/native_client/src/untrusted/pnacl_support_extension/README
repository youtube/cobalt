How to package PNaCl translator components (llc, ld, native libs) for Chrome.

Run gyp w/ GYP_DEFINES "target_arch=arm", ia32, x64, etc. to compile the
PNaCl shim for each architecture.  Running gyp will also run the
python script in this directory once for each architecture, and set up
a target-specific set of translators.  Zip up the multi-CRX, upload,
do QA, and publish. See internal wiki "PNaCl Translator in Chrome" for
convenience scripts and more details.
