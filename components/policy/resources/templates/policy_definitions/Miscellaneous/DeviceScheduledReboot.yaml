caption: Set custom schedule to reboot devices
desc: |
  Allows setting a custom schedule to reboot devices. Once set to True, the device will reboot to the schedule. The policy must be removed to cancel any more scheduled reboots.

        In user sessions and guest sessions, the following applies:

          * The users are notified that the restart will occur 1 hour before the scheduled time. They have an option to restart then or wait for the scheduled reboot. The scheduled reboot cannot be deferred.

          * There is a 1 hour grace period after the device is booted. Scheduled reboots are skipped during this period and rescheduled for the next day, week, or month, depending on the setting.

        In kiosk sessions, there is no grace period and no notifications about the reboot.
