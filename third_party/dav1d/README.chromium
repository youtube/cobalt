--[ DESCRIPTION ] ------------------
This contains the source to the dav1d video decoder; used for AV1 decoding in
Chromium. The LICENSE file is copied from libdav1d/COPYING.


--[ UPDATING ] ------------------
To update run "git pull" within the libdav1d directory to sync your local copy
of the checkout to upstream. Then you need to update the configuration files
and source listing.

First have clang (//third_party/llvm-build/Release+Asserts/bin), clang-cl
(https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/docs/win_cross.md),
and meson v0.55 or higher (https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases) in
your path. Then you can run ./generate_configs.py

Next you should update the dav1d_generated.gni file, to do that run the
./generate_source.py command.

Hopefully all that works and then you can roll DEPS to the new revision with
all the updated configuration files. If not, you'll need to debug the bots :(


-- [ OPEN ISSUES ] ------------------
1. If Windows build fails on Linux, you may need to run:
`build/vs_toolchain.py update` to regenerate FUSE links.
2. If ARM build fails with an error around clock_gettime you likely need to
install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf and gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu packages.
