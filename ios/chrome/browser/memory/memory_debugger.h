// A view that contains memory information (e.g. amount of free memory) and
// tools (e.g. trigger memory warning) to help investigate memory issues and
// performance.
//
// The debugger ensures that it remains visible by continuously calling
// bringSubviewToFront on it's parent so it should be added as a subview of the
// the application's window in order to stay visible all the times.
//
// The debugger owns some timers that must be invalidated before it can be
// deallocated so the owner must call `invalidateTimers` before a MemoryDebugger
