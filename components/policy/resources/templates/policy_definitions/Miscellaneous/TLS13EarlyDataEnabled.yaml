default: true

  TLS 1.3 Early Data is an extension to TLS 1.3 to send an HTTP request simultaneously with the TLS handshake.

        If this policy is not configured, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will follow the default rollout process for TLS 1.3 Early Data.

        If it is enabled, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will enable TLS 1.3 Early Data.

        If it is disabled, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will not enable TLS 1.3 Early Data.

        When the feature is enabled, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> may or may not use TLS 1.3 Early Data depending on server support.

        TLS 1.3 Early Data is an established protocol. Existing TLS servers, middleboxes, and security software are expected to either handle or reject TLS 1.3 Early Data without dropping the connection.

        However, devices that do not correctly implement TLS may malfunction and disconnect when TLS 1.3 Early Data is in use. If this occurs, administrators should contact the vendor for a fix.

        This policy is a temporary measure to control the feature and will be removed afterwards. The policy may be enabled to allow you to test for issues and disabled while issues are being resolved.
