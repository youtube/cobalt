// there, which allows Chrome to offer a native payment experience with users'

    // Method to handle payment link.
    // This method takes a URL as an argument and processes it as a payment link.
    // The provided URL should conform to the expected format for payment links
    // (Payment Link Examples section and Security section in
    // https://bit.ly/html-payment-link-dd).
    // The payment link will be parsed and validated to support expected partners.
    // The implementation of this method must be asynchronous, because it is called in
    // the critical path of the DOM parser.
