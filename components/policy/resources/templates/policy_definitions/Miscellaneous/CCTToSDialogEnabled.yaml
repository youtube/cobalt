caption: Enable ToS during first-run for CCT
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy is deprecated, please use the <ph name="TOS_DIALOG_BEHAVIOR_POLICY_NAME">ToSDialogBehavior</ph> policy instead.

        By default the Terms of Service are shown when CCT is first-run. Setting this policy to Disabled will cause the Terms of Service dialog to not appear during the first-run-experience or subsequent runs. Setting this policy to Enabled or leaving it unset will cause the Terms of Service dialog to appear during the first-run-experience. The other caveats are:

        - This policy only works on fully managed Android devices that can be configured by Unified Endpoint Management vendors.

        - If this policy is Disabled the BrowserSignin policy will have no effect.

        - If this policy is Disabled metricsâ€‹ will not be sent to the server.

        - If this policy is Disabled the browser will have limited functionality.

        - If this policy is Disabled admins must communicate this to end users of the device.
