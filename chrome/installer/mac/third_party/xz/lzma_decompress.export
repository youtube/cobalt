# This is a list of symbols to export from liblzma_decompress.dylib. It is not
# a complete list of symbols ordinarily exported by liblzma for decompression.
# It's limited to the set of symbols actually needed by targets that depend
# on liblzma_decompress in Chromium. Currently, this only includes xzdec and
# goobspatch.
#
# Trimming the set of exported symbols reduces the number of "roots" used for
# dead-code stripping. With fewer roots considered "live," more code may wind
# up "dead," which can reduce the size of the library.
#
# This approach reduces the size of liblzma_decompress by 16kB.
