Regression test for crbug.com/763387. Multiple font-face src urls can lead to a secondary url being
loaded during detach and not getting cancelled. We pass if we don't crash.
<style>
@font-face {
  font-family: "Font1";
  src: url("slow-ahem-loading.cgi?delay=5000"), url("../resources/Ahem.ttf");
}

body { font-family: "Font1"; }
</style>
<script>
if (window.testRunner) {
  testRunner.dumpAsText();
  testRunner.waitUntilDone();
