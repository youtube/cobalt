caption: Configure the home page URL
desc: |-
  Setting the policy sets the default homepage URL in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>. You open the homepage using the Home button. On desktop, the <ph name="RESTORE_ON_STARTUP_POLICY_NAME">RestoreOnStartup</ph> policies control the pages that open on startup.

        If the homepage is set to the New Tab Page, by the user or <ph name="HOMEPAGE_IS_NEW_TAB_PAGE_POLICY_NAME">HomepageIsNewTabPage</ph>, this policy has no effect.

         The URL needs a standard scheme, such as http://example.com or https://example.com. When this policy is set, users can't change their homepage URL in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        Leaving both <ph name="HOMEPAGE_LOCATION_POLICY_NAME">HomepageLocation</ph> and <ph name="HOMEPAGE_IS_NEW_TAB_PAGE_POLICY_NAME">HomepageIsNewTabPage</ph> unset lets users choose their homepage.
