caption: Block Browser Legacy Extension Points
default: true
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset will permit <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to apply the additional extension point security mitigation to block legacy extension points in the Browser process.

        Setting the policy to Disabled has a detrimental effect on <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>'s security and stability as unknown and potentially hostile code can load inside <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>'s browser process. Only turn off the policy if there are compatibility issues with third-party software that must run inside <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>'s browser process.

        Note: Read more about Process mitigation policies ( https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/design/sandbox.md#Process-mitigation-policies ).
