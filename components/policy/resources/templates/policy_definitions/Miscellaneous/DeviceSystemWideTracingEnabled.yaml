default: false

desc: |-
  This setting allows to collect a system-wide performance trace using the system tracing service.

        If this policy is disabled, the user cannot collect a system-wide trace using the system tracing service.
        If this policy is enabled, the user can collect a system-wide trace using system tracing service.
        If unset, this policy is disabled for managed devices and enabled for consumer-owned devices.
        Note that setting this policy to disabled only disables system-wide trace collection. Browser trace collection is unaffected by this policy.
