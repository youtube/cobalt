caption: Force Allow Chrome Apps in Kiosk mode
desc: |-
  Setting this policy to True allows Chrome Apps to continue to run in a Kiosk session, regardless of the default Chrome Apps enablement.

  Leaving this policy unset or setting this policy to False will use the default behavior defined on the device.

  Attempting to launch a disabled Chrome App will show the user a message explaining why the app was not launched and suggesting to contact their IT department.
