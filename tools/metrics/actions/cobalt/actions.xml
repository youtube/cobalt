This file is a comprehensive list of Cobalt user actions along with the owner
and description for each user action.

For best practices on writing user action descriptions, see
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/tools/metrics/actions/README.md
For details on how to modify this file to add your description, keep reading.

If an action is not user triggered, specify it using not_user_triggered="true"
as an attribute to the <action> tag.

An example entry looks like:

  <action name="ClickedFooButton">
    <owner>buttonengineer@google.com</owner>
    <description>User clicked the Foo button.</description>
  </action>

Please run ../extract_actions.py to add new actions and pretty-print this file.

If a user action is not being used any more, put an <obsolete> tag under
the <action> tag with necessary explanation. Don't delete things in this file.

<actions>

</actions>
