# Regenerating developer site contents

1.  Update documents and images. Note that files in `cobalt/site/gen` and
    `cobalt/site/reference` are autogenerated and changes in these directories
    will be overwritten by the steps below.

2.  From the root of your repository run the following to build the docsite
    Docker image.

    ```shell
    $ docker build -t docsite --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) cobalt/site/docker
    ```

3.  Run it to regenerate the site.

    ```shell
    $ docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/code docsite
    ```

4.  (Optional) To preview the changes you must commit the generated files and
    create a Pull Request. That pull request can be previewed in staging by
    following the direction for deploying the developer site.
