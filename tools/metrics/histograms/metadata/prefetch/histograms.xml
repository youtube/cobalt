    If a prefetch request has started but the head of the prefetch response has
    not been received yet when a navigation to a URL that matches the prefetch,
    then the prefetch service will block until the head of the prefetch response
    is received and then decide to serve or not serve the prefetch.

    This histogram records the amount of time that the prefetch service blocked
    until the head of the prefetch response was received. This histogram is only
    recorded for prefetches that are {WasServed} and with an Eagerness of
    {SpeculationEagerness}.

    Only recorded if `kPrefetchNewWaitLoop` is disabled.
    `PrefetchProxy.AfterClick.BlockUntilHeadDuration2.{WasServed}.{SpeculationEagerness}`
    is the corresponding metric for the enabled case. This metric will be
    removed once `kPrefetchNewWaitLoop` is launched.

    When a navigation started, `PrefetchMatchResolver2` collects potentially
    matching prefetches for it. Judging a prefetch accutally matches or not
    needs non-redirect header. If a prefetch has non-redirect header and
    actually matched, then this process ends synchronously. If not, it waits
    non-redirect headers until it finds a matched and servable one or there is
    no more candidates.

    This histogram is recorded iff the matching process didn't end synchronously
    and when the judge for a prefetch is determined. The value is the blocked
    duration (for each tuple (navigation, candidate prefetch)).

    This histogram is only recorded for prefetches that are {WasServed} and with
    an Eagerness of {SpeculationEagerness}.

    Only recorded if `kPrefetchNewWaitLoop` is enabled.
