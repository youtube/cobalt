This folder contains code refering to content capture, or the capture of 
"already-rendered stuff." The screen capture implementations (desktop, window,
tab, etc.) in content/ use these tools.  The code in this dir is all about 
deciding how to capture content w.r.t. timing, quality, and other performance
concerns.
