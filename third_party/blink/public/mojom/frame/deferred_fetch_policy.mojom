// `DeferredFetchPolicy` tells whether the "Deferred fetching" feature is
// enabled for an owner frame, and how deferred-fetch quota should
// distributed among itself and its subframes.. Every variant of this enum can
// be [directly mapped to a fixed quota][1]. The enum format is chosen over
// actual values to avoid accidental changes and for maintaining future
// compatibility.
//
// During [beginning navigation][2], the algorithm ["reserve deferred fetch
// quota"][3] is called, using the combination of the frame's inherited
// Permissions Policies of "deferred-fetch" and "deferred-fetch-minimal", to
// decide a enum variant for the FrameOwner.
