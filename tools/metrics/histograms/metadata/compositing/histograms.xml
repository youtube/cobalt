    The percent dropped frame is calculated for each sliding window of 1 second

    histogram is reported as 95pctPercentDroppedFrames_1sWindow.

    The sliding windows cover the duration of page-load (From start of page-load
    until user navigates away, or closes the tab/chrome, or when app goes to
    background). Note that this means that this metric will bias toward tabs
    that are closed more quickly, and might underreport tabs that remain open
    for a long duration.

    PercentDroppedFrames is measured by tracking the number of frames which were
    not displayed on screen out of the total number of frames expected to be
    produced and displayed. In other words, the lower this number is, the
    smoother experience.

  <summary>
    Tracks the percent of janks for a sequence by aggregating all {Sequence},
    where a sequence is a series of frames produced which contain at least one
    of the aforementioned effects.

    Jank is measured by tracking the number of abrupt increases in frame
    presentation interval, divided by the total number of frames expected to be
    produced and displayed. The lower this number is, the less the smoothness
    varies over time.

    Note that this metric is reported only when there are sufficient number of
    frames (&gt;= 100). If there are sequences with fewer frames, then these are
    aggregated until there are enough frames to produce the metric.

    Tracks the percent of dropped frames for in a 1 second sliding window.

    PercentDroppedFrames is measured by tracking the number of frames which were
    not displayed on screen out of the total number of frames expected to be
    produced and displayed. In other words, the lower this number is, the
    smoother experience.

  <summary>
    Tracks the maximum staleness value for all presentations for a particular
    sequence of frames (e.g. during scroll, animation, etc.). This is reported
    in various sub-metrics with suffixes describing the type of the sequence
    (e.g. TouchScroll etc.).

    Typically, a frame presentation is expected to last at least one vsync
    cycle, plus any number of additional vsync cycles if no updates are expected
    duration that time. If the presentation interval is prolonged due to reasons
    other than listed above, then that prolonged portion will be considered
    staleness for that frame.

    Note that this metric is reported only when there are sufficient number of
    frames (&gt;= 100). If there are sequences with fewer frames, then these are
    aggregated until there are enough frames to produce the metric.

  <summary>
    Tracks the percent of dropped frames for a sequence by aggregating all its
    animations and interactions, where a sequence is a series of frames produced
    which contain at least one of the animations/interactions. Such animations
    and interactions encompass: Compositor-thread animations; Main-thread
    animations; JS animations; scrolling; and pinch-gestures.

    PercentDroppedFrames is measured by tracking the number of frames which were
    not displayed on screen out of the total number of frames expected to be
    produced and displayed. In other words, the lower this number is, the
    smoother the experience.

    Note that this metric is reported only when there are a sufficient number of
    frames (&gt;= 100). If there are sequences with fewer frames, then these are
    aggregated until an additional sequence completes where there are (&gt;=
    100) frames available in total.

    This is a new implementation of the older
    Graphics.Smoothness.PercentDroppedFrames.AllInteractions metric.

    Tracks the staleness value for each frame presentation for a particular
    sequence of frames (e.g. during scroll, animation, etc.). This is reported
    in various sub-metrics with suffixes describing the type of the sequence
    (e.g. TouchScroll etc.).

    Typically, a frame presentation is expected to last at least one vsync

    Note that the reporting of this metric occurs as soon as a frame is
    presented, and is not affected by the length of the frame sequence.
