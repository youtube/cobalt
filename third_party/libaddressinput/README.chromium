Description:

This library lets you enter, validate, and display an address with correct
semantics for many countries around the world. The library uses the serialized
validation rules from a Google-managed server (without SLA) at
https://chromium-i18n.appspot.com/ssl-aggregate-address/. The library is used in
PaymentRequest and autofill.

Local Modifications:
- Use Chrome's version of JSON reader in chromium/json.cc.
- Use Chrome's version of loose string comparison in chromium/string_compare.cc.
- fuzz/: Added fuzz targets.
- Use base/check_op.h in chromium/input_suggester.cc.
- Use base::Value::is_string() and base::Value::GetString instead of
  base::Value::GetAsString() in chromium/chrome_storage_impl.cc.

Note:

Keep the enum in src/cpp/include/libaddressinput/address_field.h in sync with
AddressField class in AutofillProfileBridge.java file.
