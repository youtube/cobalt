caption: Automatically reload authentication flow on ChromeOS

default: null

desc: |-
  Sets the time interval (in minutes) used to automatically reload the user's authentication flow on their <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> device. This policy is introduced to handle the expiry of some services used in authentication flows when the device is left idle for some time.

  When the policy is unset or has a value of zero, the authentication flow will never be reloaded.

  When the policy is set to a positive value, the authentication flow will automatically be reloaded by the set interval.

  The maximum possible reload interval is one week (10080 minutes).

  This policy affects both login and lockscreen authentication flows.
