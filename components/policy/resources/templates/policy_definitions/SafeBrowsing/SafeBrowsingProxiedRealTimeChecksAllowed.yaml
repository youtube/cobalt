caption: Allow Safe Browsing Proxied Real Time Checks
default: true
desc: |-
  This controls whether Safe Browsing's standard protection mode is allowed to
  send partial hashes of URLs to Google through a proxy via Oblivious HTTP
  in order to determine whether they are safe to visit.

  The proxy allows browsers to upload partial hashes of URLs to Google
  without them being linked to the user's IP address. The policy also allows
  browsers to upload the partial hashes of URLs with higher frequency for
  better Safe Browsing protection quality.

  This policy will be ignored if Safe Browsing is disabled or set to enhanced
  protection mode.

  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset allows the
  higher-protection proxied lookups.

  Setting the policy to Disabled disallows the higher-protection proxied
  lookups. Partial hashes of URLs will be uploaded to Google directly with much
  lower frequency, which will degrade protection.
